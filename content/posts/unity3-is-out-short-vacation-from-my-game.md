With Unity 3 being released a little while ago, my adrenaline is pumping. I know that if I had a PRO version of it, I could have been on the beta list a long time ago. But since I am not making any money with this, I don't see it being economical to spend the money right now. Most people that are just starting in game development probably won't buy the pro version. The download is 403 MB, which is WAY bigger than the 167MB download for Unity2.6. That must say a lot about how big this release is.

That coupled with me hopefully getting a copy ofÂ  [Unity 3D Game Development by Example Beginner's Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/unity-3d-game-development-by-example-beginners-guide/book), I will take a slight hiatus from my game and delve into the new features and book. I don't think the book has much Unity3 content, but that is fine. I can probably go through it relatively quickly since I have spent some time with it already.

## Quick impression

After spending a few minutes with the new version, the layout panels have moved around a bit. There are a lot more asset packages you can import when you start Unity3d such as different character controllers, shaders, and an intriguing "tree creator". For gameobjects, it looks like you can create cloth, wind zones, and trees.

I noticed that MonoDevelop has a custom build for Unity. When you edit a script, it still defaults to UniSciTe though, which seems odd since MonoDevelop is a much better editor. I see limited intellisense with MonoDevelop when you type out any classes, so I think I will still default to Visual Studio when working with C# files (unless there is some option I can't see). Maybe I will get some good ideas to add to the game.

Check out the [cool military FPS demo](http://unity3d.com/gallery/live-demos/index.html#bootcamp) in the meantime (it might take a while to load).
