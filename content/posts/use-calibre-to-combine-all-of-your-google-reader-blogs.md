If you are anything like me, you love to read about a variety of topics. There is nothing cooler than setting up a feed reader for the first time. You start to see all of the content start pouring in and want to read everything. You begin to read, but your eyes slowly hurt after hours of reading after a couple of weeks. A great solution would be to package it all up and throw it on an e-reader device such as a Kindle, Nook, etc.

Enter [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)! (It's free)

If you haven't heard of Calibre before, it is a great tool forÂ aggregating and managing e-books and other digital reading content. I was introduced to it a few months back by the CIO of my company. It has changed the way I manage and think about reading content online.

In Calibre, if you click the "Fetch News" button it will give you a list of feeds pre-stored that you can use. Do a search for "Google Feed Uber".

There is another Google Feed aggegator that you might see, but don't use that one! I haven't had any luck with it and it doesn't seem to work right whenever I use it.

When you select the uber feed out of the list, you can type in your google account credentials so it can log in and grab everything. Hit download and be AMAZED!

Sweetness!

I have done it a few times already, and it still gives me goosebumps when I hit "download now"!

If you have a lot of different blogs you follow, it takes a little while. Some blogs don't work well with how it grabs it. For example, the Gamasutra blog has a teaser post when you first enter an article, so Calibre only will grab the teaser paragraph and not the whole post.

Boo!

But I forgive it. It does such a great job with everything else. There is probably some way to configure it to take oddities into account.

Has anyone found a way to grab feeds that have teaser posts in them? There has to be some way to let it know that the post is one level deeper within the feed item.
