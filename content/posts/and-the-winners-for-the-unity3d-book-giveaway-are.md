It was a heated battle with some great comments for the books that were being given away. Sadly, though, only six people could be randomly chosen. Â Thanks again to everyone for participating and giving their time and energy. For the random number generator, I used the [random.org](http://www.random.org/) website to pick out the winners. Names are as they were listed in the comments

1. Neil Michalares
2. Brett K.
3. Alan F.
4. David W Robinson
5. Jaimi
6. Laura

I will be notifying the winners via email how to claim their books or e-books. I hope the winners can learn a lot and show some of their hard work in the comings months!
