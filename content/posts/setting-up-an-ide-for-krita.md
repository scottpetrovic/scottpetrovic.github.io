I have recently been taking a break from Blender and starting to help with another great open source project - Krita. I posted a little while ago about the [features that Krita has](/posts/krita-the-best-art-program-youve-never-heard-of/ "Krita: The Best Art Program Youâ€™ve Never Heard Of"). I wanted to start playing around with the source code, but wasn't sure the best IDE to use when editing code. After trying out a few options, I settled on Qt Creator. If anyone is building Krita from source and wants to hook up that code to an IDE for a better developer experience, check out the Youtube video I made with me getting it set up. Make sure you can get it building from the terminal with [David Revoy's post on building Krita for cats](http://www.davidrevoy.com/article193/guide-building-krita-on-linux-for-cats).
