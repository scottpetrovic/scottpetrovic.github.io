As the week is progressing and I looking at different RSS feeds, I begin to think how difficult it is to follow the progress of the internet. As a designer, I am constantly trying to find ways to improve. Most of my ideas have been coming from design blogs like [Six Revisions](http://sixrevisions.com/), but I felt like there are even more options.

I recently started using Google reader for managing my RSS feeds and was trying to think of a different angle for learning new things. I use to use Shrook for Mac, but Google Reader is far superior. There are probably other good ones, but I usually stop when I find one that is good enough. I was talking a media person up at the church I go to and we were talking about different ways to market a website. During our conversation, it dawned on me that I really don't know that much about online marketing.

As with all things that are mysterious, I google in what I want to find out and it tells me the answer. There are some good online marketing blogs that you can subscribe to and get ideas for improvement. One that I picked out and subscribed to was

Online Marketing Blog [http:](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog  "RSS feed")[/](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog  "RSS feed")[/feeds.feedburner.com](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog  "RSS feed")[/OnlineMarketingSEOBl](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog  "RSS feed")[og](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog  "RSS feed")

Generic sounding, but exactly what I want!! This has some great posts about different upcoming media services and ways to get your idea/product/service out there. It talks quite a bit about SEO and miscellaneous things like the best way to shorten your url and landing page optimization.

I am a little skeptical about some online marketing ideas. While yes, some of the ideas could really take off, some of the ways are start up companies that really aren't that great of an idea. I guess you would just have to use your best judgement when deciding what to actually dive into.

Even though I am not into paid search advertising, one of the posts had a free 1 hour teleseminar on Google Adwords and a "cheat sheet" on how to improve your results. They tried to sign me up for a 5 day free thing, but I didn't feel like that commitment. It doesn't hurt to know a little of everything.
