I was recently told about a neat service called [Draft](http://www.draftin.com) that allows you to write in one spot and publish to many places. You don't have to publish to places to WordPress though. You can just keep it to yourself if you want.

I will probably start using Draft for a bit and see how it goes. The interface is minimal - which I love.
