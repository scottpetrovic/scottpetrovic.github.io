![chasing witches](/images/witch_color3_008-150x150.jpg "witch_color3_008")

I have been working hard on a personal illustration that I have been doing. I really have never taken a painting class before, but I read quite a bit and am hoping that my art skills can continue to improve. To see the image, click on the picture thumbnail.

The idea of witches and pumpkin bombs was inspired by an anime series called [Soul Eater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Eater_(manga) "Chasing Witches Illustration"). It is a great cartoon that has a good looking artistic style (that is usually what draws me into series). I did it all in Painter X and Photoshop CS3.

I sketched it out roughly and scanned it in where it was inked and painted. It was a great journey making this and am really excited about learning how to paint things better like fur, skin, and feathers.

I am starting to think about all of the aspects of painting from composition to foreground/background detail levels. Even looking at it now, I see a huge opportunity for improvement. Hopefully I can do some more if I have extra free time. If I can't find the free time, I guess I will have to make it. :)

This image should be a great benchmark so I can see my progression throughout the year as I do more. I will probably do more studies of certain subject matter next. Maybe an eagle or sexy female body!! Woo hoo.
