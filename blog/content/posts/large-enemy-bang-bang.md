I have been getting an itch to make some bad guys for the game. It is not only fun trying to draw something, but also really thinking about how it will walk, attack, and come to life in-game. There is nothing quite like breathing life into an idea. Here is one idea I have been toying around with for the game.

I call him Bang-Bang since he "bangs" things. I am thinking he will run like a gorilla and have long, strong swing. Maybe it could make the camera shake the closer he gets. He isn't a "boss" type of bad guy -- just a normal bad guy.

ohhh...another idea, when he punches you, you will go flying back. When you hit a building, particles will go everywhere like the building is damaged. That would be cool.

For the animations, I am thinking just an idle, walk, run, and a couple of punch animations. He is too heavy too jump and his feet are small anyway. I will probably be studying gorilla movements to try and mimic that. Maybe exaggerate it a little to make it more fun and comical.

Here is a few screenshots of the progressions.

Menacing indeed. I could have spent a little more time refining the detail, but I am not getting paid for it, so mehhh..

I should do one more small bad guy that you can kill a bunch of. That way the first enemy won't make the game too intimidating at the start.

Hmmmm...what would be a good idea for a regular bad guy? He would have to be weak and make you feel like you are strong at the beginning of the game.
