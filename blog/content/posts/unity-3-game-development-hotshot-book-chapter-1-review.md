![Unity 3 Game Development - HOTSHOT](./images/unity-3-hotshotBook.jpg "unity-3-hotshotBook")

I was just browsing Amazon last weekend and this book came up along with the sea of beginner books for Unity3D.

Dang! I am excited.How did I not know about this earlier? How can a book like this just pop up out of nowhere?

I am tired of learning about how to use the terrain tool or create materials from beginner books. I don't know what the HOTSHOT means in the title, but I guess it is like only bigshots can handle this book. Bring it on!!

Here are a couple of links to descriptions and one review so far on Amazon. You can do a search on it just as easily as me, but I am a proponent of being lazy with just making a link available.

I had to buy it of course. Read and worked through the first chapter today. Here are some points about my first impression of what to expect.

- Advanced - Goes right into the meat and potatoes without any explanation of basic concepts.
- Kindle version is hard to read the code and no bolding (a little more challenging to sift through code to see what changed).
- A few bugs in the code, but I kind of like it because it makes you think about it. When you have to fix something, you take more time to understand how the code works.
- Little to no fluff! I hate fluff and all of the superfluous chatter that some books have saying things in round-about ways. Great for marketing, bad for learning.

Just by clicking through the book (I have the Kindle), the book is looking very rich in good content. Can't wait to read the rest.

Has anyone else read this book? I would love to hear what their feedback is on it. It seems to be pretty good so far.
