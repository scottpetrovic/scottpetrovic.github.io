I don't want this to be a post where I just start rambling on, so I will try to make it as to the point as possible. Since I am a spiritual person, I have that guide me in most of my life views. All people, whether they be strangers, friends, lovers, or family, have their own agendas. They were made the way they were by how their parents raised them, their biology, and the environment that they are surrounded by.

## Role in the World

I really believe that everyone has a niche in the world. There are just so many people in the world that a lot of people end up having your same interests, motives, beliefs, and experiences. One person might make fun of you for playing a video game, the next person could be excited that you play that game too.  Some people enjoy spending their weekend getting drunk and forgetting about the work week, while others spend every waking hour cramming their life trying to use every minute that God gave them.

What is the right way to live? For me, the answer is in what you are truly excited about. For me, I love what I do for a job and don't mind spending time doing it when I come home at night or late on weekends. I don't see it as working myself to death, but living life with purpose.

That doesn't mean that I think that it is best way for everyone, but for me at this point in my life. Some people would be suicidal if they lived their life the way I live mine.  It would be down right unhealthy and they would feel terrible and irritable to everyone.

One of the most important things in my life that I have learned so far is to realize that everyone is doing and trying their hardest to live life the way they want to. It might not be the most healthy thing, or not something that you would want to publicize, but you think at the time that what you are doing is the right way.

## Personal Development Process

What is important to me is that I am constantly growing as a person. Not trying to be anyone in particular, but constantly learning new things about people, work, relationships, academic subject matters, and anything dealing with knowledge and understanding.

I still consider myself as very young and naive. so I can't afford to think for a second that I have life figured out. I can't coast on what I have learned from people, my education, or any other experiences that I have come across.

The more people I talk to and the more situations that I come into, the more I realize the danger of becoming stagnant in my development.

The best ways to develop is something I still struggle with at times. Does that mean to constantly do things that are uncomfortable to you? To learn things that you aren't interested in? To change your beliefs and morals to see something from a different angle or perspective?

## What the world does

I can only make an educated guess that you need to change based on your interests and what you really want out of life. If all you want in life is to have a car, house, wife, kids, steady income - great! If you want to be a billionaire and be president of the world - you better have a good plan.  These examples are all things we could want in the end.  Power, money, pleasure, material items or whatever.

What I don't think a lot of people understand is that say you get that billion dollars. What then? Do you want another billion, never work again and just sit on the beach everyday? Travel the globe and party every night? If your main goal in life is just to "feel" good, why doesn't everyone just take a drug like prozac where it enhances their mood all of the time? You feel good, so why even want more ?

It is because what we really seek is being loved and needed. So many people have this notion that these "things" will make them feel loved and needed. It never does. It never has and will never happen. People hear this constantly, but still go after these fruitless things. It is because society in general puts pressure to be smart, attractive, have money, have a car, house, 2.4 kids, and a respectable job. Most people find out that they probably won't be millionaires when they get a little older, so they strive just to be "normal".

If people can't reach this normal state, they do other things to make them "feel" normal. This could include alcohol, sex, gambling, excessive partying, video games, or anything else where they can escape their lives.

## What Life is About

To me, life isn't about getting things or achieving things. It is about enjoying the day you have and concentrating on what you love to do. If that means working every night until 12:30am, or watching television eating Cheetos on a Saturday night, so be it.

I believe that I am neglecting some areas in my life, but that is a choice that I am making. I think that is the right choice for me. I have thought about it for a long time and weighed the different alternative. I have chosen what to pursue. Someone might disagree with what I do, but they are just seeing it from their perspective and their life experiences.

All this is a way of saying that there are all kinds of people in the world.  It is impossible to make a judgement about them at all times.

## Understanding People

When you spend time and talk to those weird, "crazy" people, you will find they all have a sound logic - and you can understand why they think the way they do. You can still disagree with them, but your mindset changes from criticism to compassion. They act or say those weird things because of this situation in their life or how their parents told them to act. Quirky behaviors are not just randomly generated, they are cultivated through unique and isolated experiences that most people never go through.

This is a concept that I really take to heart, and is something I really try to understand when I come into contact with people. Especially those that display any of those type of attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs.
