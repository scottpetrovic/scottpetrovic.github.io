Learning about new subjects is important to me. This month I have been reading a book on a topic that gets a lot of people like me turned off and offended every time I hear the word : **Sales.**

Why read about things you despise? For me, I had to take a step back and realize how little I knew about the topic. My fear and hatred come from the negative perspectives of what tv and movies portray. A stereotype that isn't rooted in any understanding or research.

How many times do we think about a topic and reject it based off our negative perceptions? We have never studied the subject or experienced it, yet we claim mastery over it and overlook it.

The sales book I am reading is exceptionally good. One of the topics is "expanding your box". The concept involves always being ourselves in everything we do. We can't NOT be ourselves. That would be thinking outside the box. _Impossible to do._

The better solution is to expand our understanding into other areas - expanding our box.Â  Even though we can't become someone else, we _can_ grow and become more knowledgeable. Learning other skills and subjects enhance our career and life experience. It expands our horizons so we can go beyond what we normally thought was possible. Life becomes dynamic and exciting again. Sweetness!

In case you are wondering what the book is: **You, Inc.** by Harry Beckwith. This book is transforming my entire perspective on so many things in my life. Refreshing!
