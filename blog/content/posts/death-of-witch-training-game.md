I went back to my witch training game I had under source control and am finding out what I thought was going to happen. The meta data inside of the files are getting messed up and a lot of the linking is getting broken across a lot of the files. Since their are a TON of meta data and cache files that Unity stores, I think it is going to be too much work to try and figure out how to link everything back. I do have the free version and remember hearing people talk about it, so I knew this day would probably come. Unity 3.5 is suppose to have better version control support for 3rd party tools, but we will see. I doubt 3rd party version control will make it in the free version. I might just zip everything up every couple of weeks if I start again.

To make me feel better I spent some money buying a new [character development book using Blender 2.5](http://www.amazon.com/Character-Development-Blender-Jonathan-Williamson/dp/1435456254/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323028170&sr=8-1). I have never actually read a book on modeling and rigging a character before, so I am hoping it will give my next characters some much needed polish. I have only taken one 3D modeling class in college, so I am pretty excited to take my modeling skills to the next level.

As for witch training, I still have all of the code and I really liked the direction it was going. I might make a new witch character (a sexy one!) and start rebuilding it and refactoring the code.

Creating a whole game was really feeling overwhelming with all of the different aspects to it. There are so many skill sets you need to do a good job. I might just focus on the art and interactivity of everything for now. I will see what happens. Just have to take one day at a time.
