If design work is getting low, I help the developers and work on UI development. The development technologies I help out with are HTML, CSS, Angular.js, javascript, and C#.</p>

          <p class="single-column"> Most of the work I do I cannot share as it is internal tools that the company uses. I can share a bit about the process I use. I usually get direction from the head of our engineering department about features that the business wants. The highest priority items that need design work come to me. I then work with a business analyst, business stakeholder, and software developer to iron out all the details and and workflows. When everything is done I pass the designs and requirements off to the developer to get started. We use JIRA and email for managing the steps and communication. I did help build with the website shown above. That project involved helping marketing get familiar with using the Umbraco CMS and adding content that an outside agency did. There is an API that feeds in a bunch of movie titles, so I helped make sure all those processes were working.</p>

          <p class="single-column">I was put in charge of the user interface direction in 2014 for the project. For a lot of the work, we use a combination on communication tools since we are all remote: IRC, forums, and bug trackers. From this information I work with the developers and artists to come up with the final designs. The design decisions I help facilitate range from fixing confusing verbiage to creating an animation system workflow. I also spend a lot of time in the code as well doing front end development and improving the workflow and appearance. I usually do my development on Linux as that is what the other developers use. I have done a lot of wireframes and discussions if you want to see more of the process I use.</p>

          <p class="single-column">Another website I made related to Krita. Krita is built in C++, but has a Python wrapper so people can make plugins for it using the core code. I designed, wrote, and developed this site over a few weeks. To get the icons and actions pages, I had to download the Krita source code, and write a script that would parse it and extract images and text. <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/scripting-krita-org">See the project source code</a></p>

          <p class="single-column">In addition to the application interface I also designed and developed the krita.org website. This involved taking the original krita.org site and finding out what were all the problems and ask about the dreams people had for the future. I then put together wireframes and worked with the developers and artists to organize the content and develop the branding for the application. The polish was then added by adding illustrations, colors, and fonts using InDesign. The site design that exists now is a secondary update that was made in mid 2016 that I did. It uses WordPress as the back end and a custom theme I made. It uses the Polylang plugin for handling multiple languages. I organized and worked with translators from multiple countries to make this happen. </p>

I did help out quite a bit with javascript issues that arose from plug-ins and responsiveness. It was the first time I really worked much with github and LESS before. It was a nice experience and the site turned out pretty well.</p>
