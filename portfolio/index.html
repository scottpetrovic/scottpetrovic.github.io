          <p class="single-column"> Most of the work I do I cannot share as it is internal tools that the company uses. I can share a bit about the process I use. I usually get direction from the head of our engineering department about features that the business wants. The highest priority items that need design work come to me. I then work with a business analyst, business stakeholder, and software developer to iron out all the details and and workflows. When everything is done I pass the designs and requirements off to the developer to get started. We use JIRA and email for managing the steps and communication. I did help build with the website shown above. That project involved helping marketing get familiar with using the Umbraco CMS and adding content that an outside agency did. There is an API that feeds in a bunch of movie titles, so I helped make sure all those processes were working.</p>

          <p class="single-column">I was put in charge of the user interface direction in 2014 for the project. For a lot of the work, we use a combination on communication tools since we are all remote: IRC, forums, and bug trackers. From this information I work with the developers and artists to come up with the final designs. The design decisions I help facilitate range from fixing confusing verbiage to creating an animation system workflow. I also spend a lot of time in the code as well doing front end development and improving the workflow and appearance. I usually do my development on Linux as that is what the other developers use. I have done a lot of wireframes and discussions if you want to see more of the process I use.</p>

          <p class="single-column">I design and develop the krita.org marketing website since 2014. This involves iteratively making improvements and fixes as feedback is received. I work with developers, artists, and the community to prioritize changes. I procure illustrations and art mostly through social media where I request permission. I periodically collect feedback through the forums and other communication channels like IRC. The existing iteration focuses on improving the translator experience and making it easier to make edits and changes through a VS code editor IDE for new content.</p>

Content masters we recieve are too large to process, so we have a team of video technologists that normalize the videos and prepare files. This tool is a dashboard to help our content team process content that comes in, as well as help in prioriting. This was originally a Silverlight application, which I re-designed and developed working very closely with the content team. </p>

          <p class="single-column">A prototype to help solve some issues that were presented to me for our streaming solution. The main pain point was our current lack of media for movies. We currently use another 3rd party metadata provider, but we are not bringing in the media assets. This concept site is to help showcase what our streaming site could look like if we starting ingesting and displaying the new metadata. Instead of doing a design in a typical design software like Photoshop, InDesign, or Figma, I created an interactive prototype using Angular and a lot of vanilla javascipt. The end result ended up being a lot of screenshots, but there were a few demos showing it off interactively, which made a much better impact.</p>
