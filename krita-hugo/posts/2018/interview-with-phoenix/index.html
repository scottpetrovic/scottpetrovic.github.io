<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My name is Phoenix and I&rsquo;m a traditional and digital artist.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I am working my way to becoming a professional concept artist, but for now, it is a hobby.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I tend to work in multiple genres mixed together. Sometimes it&rsquo;s botanical and sci-fi, and other times it&rsquo;s all my ideas thrown onto paper then into the computer.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>An artist that really inspires me is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha">Alphonse Mucha</a>. I really love his take on women and plants. He was great at keeping a constant warm colour scheme in his works.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>About three years ago, I met someone who was also into art. Their art was beautiful and they pushed me to do better. I slowly got better over time with them as an inspiration. Early 2018, I traded some cheap alcohol based markers for their old Wacom tablet. I have been doing digital and traditional ever since.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/fallbackintoreality-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t choose between digital and traditional because I use traditional sketches to make my digital pieces. Digital is cleaner than traditional, which is more appealing to the human eye.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I found out about Krita because I wanted a free software that would do what I wanted. Also, there is a dark theme, so it is easier on my eyes at night.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>My first impression of Krita was excitement because I just kept messing with all the cool brushes and tools.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/Phoenix-Side-View-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>What I love about Krita is that it doesn&rsquo;t take up that much RAM compared to other softwares I have used. It makes it really easy to record speedpaints for YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Brush processing is a pain at times, but that can be blamed on my lower spec PC. There&rsquo;s a few bugs, but that happens with every software out there and no one can avoid it.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>What sets Krita apart is that its brushes and other tools are a lot cleaner to use compared to other software I have used.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/watch-and-burn-800.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My most recent work that I made. I titled it Watch and Burn. The reason I love it so much is because I finally was able to keep a very consistent colour scheme.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I used a traditional sketch that was in blue pencil, then edited it in a photo software to make it crisp looking. I put it in Krita and used the multiply blending mode, so you could see the sketch. The last thing I did was colour with a basic ink brush and blended with the blender blur tool.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>People can see more of my work on these platforms: - <a href="https://instagram.com/ahumanphoenix">Instagram</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/AHumanPhoenix">Twitter</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP2qyZQO5Uj6zBGyt4l-O4w">YouTube</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Please continue developing Krita because this is the most friendly art software I have ever used in a long time. Also, art can be hard, but people should continue even if they are in a rut.</p>
