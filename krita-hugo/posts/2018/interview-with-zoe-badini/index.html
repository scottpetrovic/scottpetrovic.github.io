<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Zoe and I live in Italy. Aside from painting I love cooking and spending my time outdoors, preferably snorkeling in the sea.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m just now starting to take my first steps professionally after many years of painting as a hobby.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I love to imagine worlds and stories for my paintings, so most of what I&rsquo;ve done is related to fantasy illustration and some concept art. I also do portraiture occasionally.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/The-Cook.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>There are way too many to mention, I try to learn as much as I can from other artists, so there are a lot of people I look up to. There are a few I often watch on Youtube, Twitch, or other platforms, I learned a lot from their videos: Clint Cearley, Marco Bucci, Suzanne Helmigh, David Revoy.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I was used to traditional drawing, then a few years ago I saw some beautiful digital illustrations and was curious to try my hand at it, there was this old graphic tablet at my parents&rsquo; house, so I tried it. What I made was atrocious, but it didn&rsquo;t discourage me!</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Working digitally I feel like a wizard, with a touch of my wand I have a huge array of tools at my disposal: different techniques, effects, trying out ideas and discarding them freely if they don&rsquo;t work out. It&rsquo;s also a big space saver!</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/The-road-to-Galaverna.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I had heard it mentioned a couple of times, then I posted a painting on reddit and a user recommended Krita to me, I was a bit uncertain because I was used to my setup, my brushes and so on&hellip; But the seed was planted, in the span of a few months I was using Krita exclusively and I never went back.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I was understandably a bit lost and watched a few tutorials, but I found the program intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Its accessibility and completeness: there&rsquo;s everything I may need to paint at a professional level and it&rsquo;s easy to find and figure out. Krita also comes with a very nice selection of brushes right out of the box.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/Zelukoths-Temple.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Nothing really annoys me, as for improvements I wanted to say the text tool, but I know you&rsquo;re working on it and it was already improved in 4.0.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>As I said it&rsquo;s professional and easy to use, I feel like it&rsquo;s made for me. It&rsquo;s also free, which is great for people just starting out.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="images/posts/2018/Big-Game-Hunt.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My favourite is always one of the latest I did, just because I get better over time. In this case it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Game Hunt&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>Nothing particular in terms of technique, my brushes come from the Krita presets, my own experiments and a lot of bundles I gathered from the internet over time.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>

<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I want to thank the Krita team for making a great software and I encourage people to try it, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. If you use it and like it, consider donating to help fund the project!</p>
