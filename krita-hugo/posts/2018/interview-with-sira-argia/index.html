<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sira Argia. I am a digital artist who uses FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) for work. I come from Indonesia, Sanggau Regency, West Kalimantan.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that I am professional in my digital painting work because there&rsquo;s so much things I need to learn before I achieve something that can be called &ldquo;professional&rdquo;. At the beginning, it&rsquo;s just a hobby. I remember my first painting artwork was very bad, haha. But now I think my artworks are far better than the first. I believe in &ldquo;practice makes perferct&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I call it &ldquo;semi realistic&rdquo; art style. I usually use anime/manga or Disney style for the character&rsquo;s face look-alike and use realistic shading a little bit.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>David Revoy and Sara Tepes. They inspire and help me a lot with their tutorials.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I started in 2014-2015. I used the traditional method (with pencil and paper) and traced it with Inkscape.</p>
<p>Then 2016. That&rsquo;s the first time I tried digital painting because I just bought my first graphic tablet that time.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I am not in the position that I have to choose between digital or traditional painting, because if there&rsquo;s a teacher, I really need to learn all of them. The reasons why I am doing digital painting at this moment is that iI can find tutorials everywhere on the internet and it&rsquo;s easy to practice because I have the monitor and the digital pen for digital painting. Besides, I am working as a freelance artist and every client asks for digital raw files. <img src="/images/posts/2018/razan.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>2014 is the year that I first started to try Linux on my laptop, and then I knew that Windows programs don&rsquo;t run perfectly on Linux even using &ldquo;wine&rdquo;. My curiosity about Linux and the alternative programs led me to Krita. The more time I spent with Linux, the more I fell in love with it. And finally I thought that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose Linux as a single OS on my laptop and Krita as a digital painting program for work someday after I get my first graphic tablet.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>The first Krita that I tried is version 2.9. I followed David Revoy&rsquo;s blog and youtube channel to learn his tutorials about Krita. I thought at the time that Krita was very laggy for bigger canvas sizes. But I still used it as my favorite digital painting program because I thought that Krita was a powerful program.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Powerful and Free Open Source Software.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I hope Krita will not use so much processor and ram in the future, it always gets to force close when I use many layers in a bigger canvas.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used other painting programs for a long time except Krita. So I don&rsquo;t know, Krita has unique features. For example, other programs have something called called &ldquo;clipping layer&rdquo; but Krita called it &ldquo;inherit alpha&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my character who is called Seira. Still my favourite because this is the first time I didn&rsquo;t pick any palette colors from the internet and I started to understand about &ldquo;source light&rdquo; in the digital painting.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2018/seira.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<h4 id="a-sketch">a. Sketch</h4>
<p>I usually begin from the stickman. I thought about pose and the composition at this point. Then I start to draw the naked body from the stickman. That&rsquo;s the part where I have to draw the anatomy clearly. After that, I start to draw the costume of the character. I am not really good at line art, so I let it become a sketch because for me, it&rsquo;s just a guide to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="b-coloring">b. Coloring</h4>
<p>This is a very important part for me because I need to be clear with the shading, texture of the material, value, etc. For the brushes, the Deevad bundle and the Krita default brush bundle are more than enough.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.aflasio.com">www.aflasio.com</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I just want to give a message to the people who see this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to use FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) like Krita for example, than use proprietary software (even worse if you use the cracked software). It&rsquo;s bad. Really&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
