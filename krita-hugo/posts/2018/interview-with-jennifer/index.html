<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost 35 years old, from a city called Passo Fundo, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I like cats, cartoons and rock and roll. 1994 was the year when I started to have some interest in drawing. I looked for learning how to draw just for fun and sometimes to let my soul talk. But I can say that the digital art that I started practicing last year has helped me get rid of a recent depression.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>As a hobby. At least for now.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I usually draw cartoons. But I also like painting nature and fantasy elements.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2018/maila-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>Most times when I draw, I don&rsquo;t look up to a specific artist. I search random images on internet or the painting comes from my own mind. I think any kind of art should come from the artist&rsquo;s inner soul.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>It occurred last year, in May, I guess. I had no job but I had a nasty depression. Then my husband said he would like to learn how to draw and start work with that. It was when I started to draw again. Yes, I had stopped drawing, limiting myself to draw just when I had nothing more to do. Then we got an online course from Ivan Quirino and here I am, less than an year later, doing all kinds of digital painting.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>The practicality. It is really hard when you do something wrong drawing at the traditional way. In digital painting, you can redo as many times as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>At Youtube or at some blog. I can&rsquo;t tell for sure.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>When I used Krita for the first time I already knew most of the tools, so it was easy to use. But I needed to learn more, then I watched a video that explained the basic tools and method to paint. I thought then that Krita was a good tool for painting. Today I can tell it&rsquo;s a great tool for digital artists. My personal opinion: Krita is the best and I really can&rsquo;t use a different program.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>The quick access to the tools I need. The ease to work with it. I like so much of that function that allows you to paint just the line art. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Nothing! As I said before: I really enjoy work with Krita and I recommend it to anyone who is choosing this path of digital art.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>The brushes, the way Krita works with layers (for example: if you have a line on the top layer and you paint a background on the layer below, you won&rsquo;t paint over what is drawn on the top layer). I don&rsquo;t know about the functionality of all painting software, but I think this is pretty cool.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2018/the-peace-of-the-mermaid.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I like my latest work. At the time I made the work, I hadn&rsquo;t thought about a name yet. But looking at it now, I could call it &ldquo;The peace of the mermaid&rdquo;. I think it fits well.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not good with names of techniques, but I used the default brushes and some of those by David Revoy (airbrush, fill brush, wet brushes, some ink for the little details, some customized brush &ldquo;LJF water brush 3&rdquo;). I also used effect layers. So I started with the water base, just filling the area with blue and white tones. Then I painted the sky, mixing tones of blue with white. The sun was made with an airbrush, mixing yellow and white. After that, I used the customized brush to do the details of the water. Always mixing the colors to get the vision that I was looking for. Then I painted the blocks of sand, leaving the details, done with &ldquo;splat_texture - Marcas&rdquo;, for the end. At this point, I could start drawing the mermaid. Started by doing a shadow mermaid. After that, I put the colors, lights and shadows and the details. The effect layers were used to get more luminance on a specific element (In Portuguese: Luz viva - used on the mermaid and the starfish -, Luz suave - used to get the luminance on the full scene - , Desvio linear - to get the effect on the water light).</p>

<p>I just wanted to thank the people that work to improve Krita, an amazing box of tools for digital painting!</p>
