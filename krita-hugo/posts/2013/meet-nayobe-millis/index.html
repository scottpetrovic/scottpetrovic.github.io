    <p>Hi to all, today we have for you an interview with Nayobe Millis. She is a young girl from United States (she is only 16) who has collaborated with us in the webshop, giving us permissions to make merchandise with this cute artwork: <a href="http://nayobe.deviantart.com/art/Sheep-s-Pan-Flute-384152183">Sheep&rsquo;s Pan Flute</a>. She is our younger artist! thanks to her and enjoy the interview :)</p>

<p><strong>Hi Nayobe,</strong> <strong>Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</strong> Right now I paint as a hobbyist, but I wish to improve my art skills so I can paint professionally.</p>
<p><strong>When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</strong> I remember it being years ago when I was a little kid in elementary school. I used to go on the computer and scribble on MS Paint using a laptop trackpad. I wanted to see if I could actually draw something on the computer like how I drew on paper.</p>
<p><strong>What is it that makes you choose digital over the traditional painting? or Do you still prefer traditional means, if so, why?</strong> I like both digital and traditional painting. It&rsquo;s easier painting digitally for me though, because you can really put in detail without worrying if you mess up. I haven&rsquo;t really painted much traditionally so I cannot compare that.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</strong> Well, I was always stuck with MS Paint, but then I learned about GIMP through DeviantArt. People who used it says GIMP is like Photoshop except it&rsquo;s free and I always heard how good Photoshop was, so I gave GIMP a shot. GIMP was the only open source community I heard about, I only learned about Krita through a DA user named TysonTan and I found other open source communities by watching speed paint on YouTube.&ndash; yay! Tyson Tan is the artist who made our mascot!&ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</strong> I have not contributed to any FOSS projects for I had no clue what they were or if that even existed. I guess doing this for Krita will be my first.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first take on it?</strong> Woo, at first, I found Krita quite confusing to work with. I was just transferring over to it after using Paint Tool SAI so I had no clue how Krita worked. Took some time getting used to it. I&rsquo;m still vague on it now, but I&rsquo;m slowly starting to understand the way how it works. C:</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about Krita?</strong> The thing I love about Krita is the brushes and the way you can paint on it. There were so many brushes to experiment with. I personally like the square/rectangle brushes, it gives a painting effect. I also love how Krita keeps the color you used after you use them.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</strong> I can&rsquo;t really think of anything needing improvement. Maybe a curve tool that doesn&rsquo;t need you to connect back to point you started with in order for the line to be filled. There isn&rsquo;t anything I hate about Krita C:</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</strong> I guess it would be the brush variety.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</strong> I barely did much pieces with Krita, but I gess it would be my most recent one <a href="http://nayobe.deviantart.com/art/Sheep-s-Pan-Flute-384152183">Sheep&rsquo;s Pan Flute</a></p>

<p><strong>What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?</strong> I like how I did the sky, grass, and the sheep itself. Sure it&rsquo;s not perfect, but I like painting messy. I used the default brush to sketch and ink and I used the &ldquo;Block_Paint&rdquo; brush for everything else, as well as using the &ldquo;Basic_Airbrush&rdquo; tool for the highlighting glow.</p>
<p>You can see her DeviantArt <a href="http://nayobe.deviantart.com/">here</a>. Thank you so much Nayobe and thanks for trust in Krita :)</p>
