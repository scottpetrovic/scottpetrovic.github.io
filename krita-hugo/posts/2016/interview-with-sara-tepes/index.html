<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My name’s Sara Tepes, I’m 17 years old,  I was born in Romania but grew up in the U.S. and I live super close to Washington D.C. I love roses, rabbits, tea, and historical movies.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I work on commissions and various projects and get paid for my work, so I’m sort of a freelance part-time illustrator, but I also draw and paint as a hobby. I hope to major in graphic design and be a professional full time freelancer.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>Traditional drawing and both digital and traditional painting. <img src="images/posts/2016/Garden.jpg" alt="Garden"></p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-the-mostwho-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you the most—who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>I have been inspired by Tony DiTerlizzi ever since I was a tiny kid who read the Spiderwick Chronicles. He was my art god for the longest time, and I still love his work; his technique is brilliant and the creatures he creates are just alive on the paper. Lois Van Baarle, aka Loish, (<a href="http://loish.net/">http://loish.net/</a>) has been a huge role model ever since I first discovered her digital paintings in 2012. Her paintings have such wonderful colors, details, expressions and body language!</p>
<p>Traditional painters include John Singer Sargent, John William Waterhouse, Claude Monet, Gustav Klimt, and Alphonse Mucha.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I used to read a bunch of &ldquo;How to Draw Manga&rdquo; books which discussed basic digital art with cell shading.  I started digital painting in 2011 when I was 12 with this old, crappy photo effect program. It basically had an airbrush feature and a select tool and paint bucket. It was super simplistic and wasn’t even meant for digital painting, but I really wanted to digitally color in the manga drawings I was doing at the time.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Well, I work in both mediums, but I generally prefer digital painting because it’s super reliable. I don’t have to worry about my paint palette drying before I can use it, working in terrible lighting and getting all the colors skewed up, or having a really long drying time on the canvas. There’s no prep or cleanup to it.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>When I got a new computer, I was looking for free digital painting software. I was 13 and didn’t have $900 for Adobe Photoshop, but I didn’t like pirating the program. I found MyPaint, Gimp, and Krita and installed and used all of them.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I was curious about the program but I didn’t like the brush blending. At the time, all the &ldquo;painterly&rdquo; brushes had color blending and it annoyed me a lot. Thank God that’s not the case with the program right now!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>It doesn’t have a huge learning curve like other programs. It’s straightforward, super professional, has a bunch of great features and brushes, and autosaves every minute! It’s pretty fantastic!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>The ONLY thing that I don’t like about Krita is that it doesn’t have a freehand warping tool how Photoshop has Liquefy or Gimp has iWarp. That would be really helpful honestly.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favorite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favorite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>Probably &ldquo;Red Dress&rdquo;. I love the backlighting and the vibrant red highlights. I really have to focus on how colors are affected by light, and I think I did a pretty good job with this one. <img src="images/posts/2016/Red-Dress.jpg" alt="Red Dress"></p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>Just the color tool and the bristles_hairy brush.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
