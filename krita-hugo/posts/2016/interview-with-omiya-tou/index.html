<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a self-taught Sunday digital painter from Tokyo, Japan. I publish my artworks under my alias Omiya Tou. Sometimes I&rsquo;m also a FLOSS tester or translator and lately I&rsquo;ve committed translations for G&rsquo;MIC.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Currently I paint completely as a hobby for fun and stress-relief.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I usually do 2D drawings/paintings of manga-styled portraits.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>When I create my artwork I always try to convey the tranquility and warmth of Nihon-ga works such as those by <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=kaii+higashiyama&amp;tbm=isch">Kaii Higashiyama</a>. Also I have been very much impressed by <a href="http://tumblr.tanji.jp/">Yoko Tanji&rsquo;s versatility in styles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>In 2002, when I was 14, I did what can be called digital painting for the first time.Â  I think it was a Final Fantasy fanart. In the initial few years I had created my artworks by digitizing pencil linearts with a scanner shared in the school that I was in, taking back the data to my house with floppy discs and coloring them with a mouse and a freeware painting app named Pixia on a Windows XP laptop.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>It would be that digital media are less time- and space-consuming, easier to revise and enable me to focus on the pure joy of painting, leaving every boring task to the computer.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2016/omiya_2.jpg" alt="omiya_2"></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I did when I was trying out painting apps available in Ubuntu to which I migrated from Windows to run GIMP at its full speed.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>When I tried Krita for the first time it was still a sort of tech demo and unsuitable for daily use, but I felt it was worth keeping track of &ndash; and actually I&rsquo;ve been excited seeing how much it has improved since then.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>There are quite a lot of things, but I especially love the quick pop-up palette, numerous drawing assistants, well-tuned preset brushes, and the hyper-energetic dev team. :)</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>For me Krita is just awesome lately, but if I must say something I think it will be nice if the color curves dialog window is resizeable and the measure tool remains visible when another tool is active.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Canvas tilting/flipping, GPU acceleration and CMYK capability.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d pick this because I like the sense of depth and atmosphere:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2016/omiya_1.jpg" alt="omiya_1"></p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I colored this by overlaying a solid blue-gray layer which is set to <em>color dodge</em> mode onto a grayscale image. A lot of this is painted using a brush named <em>Bristles_hairy</em>, definitely one of my favorites.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I cross-post my works onto <a href="http://namito111.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a>, <a href="http://yukue.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/112127384@N04/albums/72157644998156291">Flickr</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>On my Flickr page I post my artworks under a CC-BY license in their full resolution, so please feel free to use them. Thank you!</p>
