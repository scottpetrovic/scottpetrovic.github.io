<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I recently graduated college with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Graphic Design, English, and Biblical Studies. Drawing has been a passion of mine for over 15 years, and I&rsquo;m very happy to still have time to do it! Now I&rsquo;m married and stay at home to work on my art, jewelry store, and blog.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I would consider myself a freelance artist and hobbyist. Most of my art is just my hobby, but I also do commissions and other freelance work here and there.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I mostly draw digital art in my cartoon style. I have a lot of original characters with elaborate designs and backstories, so those are fun to draw. I also really enjoy drawing fanart. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll draw realistic things as well, like portraits and still life.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>I admire quite a few artists, but a couple of my most favorite ones are <a href="http://instagram.com/cyarine">Cyarine</a> and <a href="http://loish.net">Loish</a>. I love their painting styles and techniques, as that is one area I always want to improve on.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>When I was around 7 years old (I think?) my family got our first iMac computer, which came with a program called Appleworks. I would draw pictures and create animations on that and GIMP using only my mouse, and I actually got pretty good at it! Then when I got a real drawing tablet, I lost the ability to draw with just the mouse haha.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Ctrl+Z is a beautiful thing. So are the lasso and transform tools. They make it easier to perfect tiny details until you get it right!</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>My friend <a href="http://ameliadrawsthings.tumblr.com/">Amelia Hamrick</a> was doing commissions to help raise money to donate to Krita, and I love her work as well, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out!</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I had been used to drawing with GIMP which really isn&rsquo;t great for drawing, and Photoshop didn&rsquo;t work exactly the way I wanted either. I kept telling everyone about how great Krita was because it felt so much more realistic to draw on.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Pressure sensitivity, smooth blending, super cool useful brushes for shading and stuff, the ability to flip and rotate the canvas (my favorite part), and autosave (also my favorite part). <img src="images/posts/2016/laura-leopard-trench-coat-800px.png" alt="laura-leopard-trench-coat-800px"></p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I do wish there was an option to have a preview window in the corner. Like some art programs have a small window showing the whole canvas and a square to show where you&rsquo;ve zoomed in. It does get kind of annoying to have to zoom in and out all the time to make sure the drawing doesn&rsquo;t look weird.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve only really used Photoshop and GIMP (and Appleworks but that was basically MS Paint). Those programs weren&rsquo;t very cooperative with pressure sensitivity and being realistic to traditional drawing/painting. Krita is great because it seems to be very customizable and runs smoothly, and definitely seems meant for artists who draw and paint.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m always finding new drawing methods that I like better than my old ones, so it&rsquo;s hard to pick a favorite because I&rsquo;m always improving. However, <a href="http://%3Chttp://sketchesbylaura.tumblr.com/post/144509538912/i-love-how-this-turned-out-this-sketchy%3E">this doodle</a> was definitely one that I had the most fun drawing. The brushes and colors worked so well together, and I was super excited with it when it was finished!</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I believe I used the Ink_Tilt brushes for sketching and Basic_Wet brushes for coloring. Those are the ones I use for most of my more &ldquo;finished&rdquo; work now, but they&rsquo;re also great for more sketchy drawings like the one I mentioned!</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p><a href="http://sketchesbylaura.com">Main website</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/sketchesbylaura">Instagram</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/sketchesbylaura">Twitter</a> <a href="http://sketchesbylaura.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> <a href="http://facebook.com/sketchesbylaura">Facebook</a> <a href="http://twitch.tv/sketchesbylaura">Twitch</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTlkAk2N0ZZOc_3dJljhn4g">YouTube</a> <a href="http://patreon.com/sketchesbylaura">Patreon</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I am so glad Krita is available for so many different artists to use, and I appreciate these interviews as a way to find new artists to get to know better!</p>
