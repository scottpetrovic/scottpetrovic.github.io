<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Tomáš Marek. I&rsquo;m 22 years old, self-taught digital/traditional artist and student, and I currently live in the Czech Republic. Unlike most of the other artists I started drawing pretty late, about 4 years ago, mainly because I never had any sign of a talent for anything, and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. It was 4 years ago when I found out about my great-grandfather who was an artist (landscape painter) which was the initial trigger for me, &ldquo;I want to be an artist&rdquo;. Since then I draw pretty much every day.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m working on my personal project, it will be a graphic novel, can&rsquo;t tell you much about it yet, and developing my own style which I call #BigNoses.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2016/PurpleGirl.png" alt="PurpleGirl"></p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>In this moment I see myself more like a hobbyist than professional, because right now I&rsquo;m still a student and I&rsquo;m working on my degree in computer graphics, which is very time consuming. However, from time to time I do some freelance or commissions. So lets say I&rsquo;m both.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I actually never thought about drawing in some specific genre, I pretty much draw what and how I feel that day.</p>
<h3 id="thelastwatchmanimagesposts2016thelastwatchmanpng"><img src="/images/posts/2016/TheLastWatchman.png" alt="TheLastWatchman"></h3>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t pick just one artist, there are so many of them. But if I could pick three of them, the first would be my great-grandfather who introduced me to art, the second is Sycra Yasin who taught me that mileage is more important than talent, and the most recent one is <a href="http://www.kimjunggius.com/">Kim Jung Gi</a> because, well, just look at his work and you will know why.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>My first time was in 2012 in the house of my friend, who had a Wacom Cintiq 13. He let me try it with Photoshop CS4 and my first impression of it was &ldquo;I want one&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>That would probably be freedom of tools. Because I&rsquo;m the constantly changing and erasing type of guy. And with digital not only that changing stuff is fast and clean but also, as the saying goes, &ldquo;pixels are cheap&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2016/TheLonelyFisherman.png" alt="TheLonelyFisherman"></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>The first time I heard about Krita was about 2 years ago on Sycra&rsquo;s Youtube channel, I think he drew his self-portrait. But I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it because in that time I was using Photoshop for my paintings, which I didn&rsquo;t like but it was the only software that I knew how to use.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>OK, I remember this moment very well. When I first opened Krita, picked the first brush I saw, I think that it was the Color Smudge type, then I started with painting, and this is what I had in my mind: &ldquo;This is weird, but kinda cool, but weird&hellip; yeah I love it&rdquo;. I hope this sums it up well.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Mainly these almost traditional-like brush engines, and the fact that it runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I would like to see a realtime histogram of all visible layers, not only for one selected layer. And some performance improvement for filters.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a GNU/Linux user and when I wanted to paint I always had to reboot to Windows to use Photoshop for painting, so with Krita I don&rsquo;t have to use Windows at all.</p>
<p>And as I said before, I love Krita&rsquo;s brush engines.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>This is hard; it&rsquo;s like asking parents which is their favourite child, but if I had to choose it would be probably my recent painting from my series #BigNoses called &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Something&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="itssomethingimagesposts2016itssomethingpng"><img src="/images/posts/2016/ItsSomething.png" alt="It&amp;rsquo;sSomething"></h3>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>For most of my work I&rsquo;m using my own brush, which is a rectangle brush with pressure size and softness, plus airbrush and some texture brushes. And my technique is pretty simple pipeline: lineart → base colors → shades → rendering.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m frequently posting my work on these sites:</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for inviting me to this interview. I really admire the work you&rsquo;re doing on Krita, so keep going this way.</p>
