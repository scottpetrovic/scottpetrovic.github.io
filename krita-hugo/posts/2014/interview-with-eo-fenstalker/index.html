<h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrea, better known as Eo Fenstalker anywhere that it matters. I&rsquo;m a freelance artist in my 30s living in Melbourne, Australia and I primarily focus on animal and fantasy related artwork under the name Toast Weasel Illustration.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m somewhere in between. I take commissions and sell prints of my work, however being so new back into art I have the trek ahead of me to gain exposure and enough work to comfortably sustain me. I did a lot of art when I was younger, however I was put on an SSRI medication in my early 20s to manage anxiety and it severed my ability to be creative so I did almost nothing from 2001 to 2011. I had given up on the idea of having art back in my life at all until one evening in 2011 I picked up my art materials and launched into doing photorealistic pet and wildlife portraits practically overnight. At this point I was still unable to draw upon imagination for my work but I was earning success in art exhibitions and publications both at home and internationally. While this was great, I was disheartened that I still seemed unable to bring a truly creative element into my work and didn&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;whole&rsquo; as an artist. Krita changed all this for me in early 2014.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I first encountered digital art 1997 when I got a free copy of Photoshop 3.0 with the purchase of a scanner. I began to learn how to paint using a mouse at first, and then with a Wacom tablet and even throughout my decade of artistic drought I still, from time to time, picked up Photoshop to play around a little. I still have all my old art files from all that time ago and occasionally enjoy looking back on my old work to see how far I&rsquo;ve come, despite the long break.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. I still do some traditional work because I enjoy working in different mediums. Digital art can be gratifyingly fast and easy to fix mistakes but I still enjoy the unique challenges that traditional art presents.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>I learned of open source communities way back when I discovered the internet around 1996. I like the idea of a community of passionate people all pitching in to develop and maintain software though my skills don&rsquo;t lie in this field so I generally can&rsquo;t contribute beyond being openly excited about using the software or doing a little bug reporting. Aside from Krita, the most notable open source program I have used regularly is Blender.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>I try and help find and report bugs as I use Krita. It can sometimes add to the difficulty level of achieving finished work when using pre-release builds, but it&rsquo;s fun in its own way and I enjoy being able to contribute, even though it&rsquo;s in such a minor way. I also happily allow my art to be used in promotional material for Krita.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I was introduced to the program early this year by a friend who was quite excited over it. I was dubious because I&rsquo;d tried other art programs and was always frustrated by having to learn new a new UI/work flow, to the point that I&rsquo;d give up and return to Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-take-on-it">What was your first take on it?</h3>
<p>When I sat down to try it, I started messing about with the standard brushes and sat up with a bolt of excitement because suddenly something felt -better- to use than the old faithful. The UI was a little hard to get a grip on after so long using the same program but the way the brushes handled felt so amazing to me that I persevered and it didn&rsquo;t take long before going back to Photoshop felt really alien.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I love how the brushes feel to use and I love how the devs take what artists say they want and turn it into reality. Instead of being a passive user, I feel like I can have some input and it makes me feel like I have a personal tie to the software and its community. I also love the fact that finding Krita fired up my enthusiasm for art to such a point that my creativity came flooding back practically overnight when I found it. Thirteen years after losing the ability, I can now paint entire scenes from imagination the way I used to and I feel &lsquo;whole&rsquo; as an artist again.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>Some things take far too long to execute such as many of the filters and some of the brushes at max size. At this point I have a hybrid workflow between Krita and Photoshop where I will pass the file back and forth to accomplish various things that just take too long in Krita. I look forward to the day when I can all but retire Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</h3>
<p>It would definitely have to be Little Forest Guardian.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-you-like-about-it-what-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m enchanted by the idea of mixing my love of nature with my love of dragons and fantasy. I tried to convey a sense of it being a still from an animated movie using motion and depth of field and feel that I was fairly successful judging by peoples&rsquo; reactions. I was floored when I had this image made into prints as the colours came out so rich and jewel-like. I honestly cannot remember what brushes I used - it was definitely a large variety as I was (and still am) experimenting heavily with brushes and techniques.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-like-to-share-it-with-our-site-visitors">Would you like to share it with our site visitors?</h3>
<p>For sure! It&rsquo;s at the top of this post.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I have a website with more of my work at <a href="http://www.toastweasel.com" title="Eo's web site">http://www.toastweasel.com</a>. It&rsquo;s still incomplete but I hope to have it finished very soon and the majority of my traditional and digital works are there. I will also soon be selling prints via the site, though for now I can be contacted directly for these.</p>
