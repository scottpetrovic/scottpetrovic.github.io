<h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I’m a digital painter, illustrator, concept artist and game developer, currently living in Dresden, Germany.</p>
<p>In January 2008 I started drawing and painting regularly. I went from fineliner drawings to vector art, pencil drawings, sculpting, papercuts, linocuts, fabric design, oil/acrylic paintings, fabric design, typography until I finally found my preferred medium. In 2010 my apprenticeship at a photographer agency ended and I started to work on my art full-time. The same year my husband and I also successfully crowdfunded the creative commons music album &ldquo;paniq - Beyond Good and Evil&rdquo;. I created the cover and booklet art and my husband composed the music. In May 2012 we founded our company &ldquo;duangle&rdquo; and started another crowdfunding campaign for our game in development &ldquo;NOWHERE&rdquo;, a hardcore alien life simulator.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>Both, sporadically. I’m not comfortable with either label. Art happens. :-)</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I wanted to get more out of my monochromatic fineliner drawings. I scanned and vectorized these drawings with Inkscape and added some color with MyPaint. That’s how it started. Since 2013 I enjoy painting mostly digitally.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Almost no costs, more freedom.</p>
<p>No need for a studio to paint. No storage problems. Sharing new artworks is easier and you don’t have to scan the pictures first, which really pays off once the paintings get bigger. Nevertheless I hope that someday I will be able to afford to work with oils. I miss a messy working space with paint everywhere. Sadly we are living in a rented apartment and I can’t do what I want with it.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>My husband is a musician and programmer. He licensed all his work under creative commons. I started to love open source projects, too. I’m very thankful that there are people who work, live for the community and people who support them.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>We, duangle, are currently developing an open source game engine &ldquo;Liminal&rdquo; for no-static-assets procedural games, using C and LuaJIT:<a href="https://bitbucket.org/duangle/liminal_lua/src">https://bitbucket.org/duangle/liminal_lua/src</a>. My husband is doing the programming and I’m an alpha tester. ;-)</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>A friend mentioned Krita in 2010, claiming that it was the best open source alternative to Photoshop. Had to try it and never stopped working with it. On a sidenode I’ve never worked with commercial art software before, but I’m not eager to either.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-the-first-thing-you-made-with-it">What was the first thing you made with it?</h3>
<p>I had a pencil sketch in my sketchbook, scanned it and added some color. The result is on my deviantArt page - &ldquo;Study No.80&rdquo;: <a href="http://faith303.deviantart.com/art/study-no-80-361827667">http://faith303.deviantart.com/art/study-no-80-361827667</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I love to work with a tool that is continuously improving. New features are always such a joy. They give you new ways to explore art. Krita is fun. I can’t put it into better words. Everyone should give it a try :)</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>The usual problem with software  - I hate it when the program crashes and I forgot to save the current progress. Krita has an auto-save mode but it doesn’t always seem to work. A reminder to everyone: save more often! Then, sometimes I duplicate a layer and can’t move it to the place I want, so I have to delete the duplicated layer and try again. That’s all, I’m happy otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>More features and possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</h3>
<p>Not an easy task. I’m the worst critic. One of my favorites is &ldquo;Keeper of Secrets&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-you-like-about-it-what-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I love wildcats. It was fun to paint the fluffy fur and the lynx eyes.</p>
<p>Can’t remember all the brushes, definitely the block and hard oval opacity detail brush. I try to experiment with all brushes, patterns, textures that can be used in Krita.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-like-to-share-it-with-our-site-visitors">Would you like to share it with our site visitors?</h3>
<p>Sure! You can find it on my deviantArt page: <a href="http://faith303.deviantart.com/art/Keeper-of-Secrets-484685409">http://faith303.deviantart.com/art/Keeper-of-Secrets-484685409</a>.</p>
