    <h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us about yourself?</h3>
<p>My name is Rose and I&rsquo;m a 25 year old freelance artist from Melbourne, Ausfailia. I really like anatomy and medical science which is a theme among a lot of my work- or it&rsquo;s at least inspired by it. I love videogames, nature, robots and old fashioned stuff. Etc etc. You can pretty much gather everything you need to know from my art itself; it&rsquo;s very personal to me.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>Professionally. Currently finishing a certificate IV in small business management so I can register as an official full time business. I&rsquo;ve been doing art as part time work since 2005, though.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve drawn in MS paint since I was like ten. It was my favourite thing ever as a kid haha. I thought it was magic! But, well, photoshop etc&ndash; I had been using that for a decade, before I found you lot at the start of this year.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Less set up time, less messy, less expensive. Also its diversity is really wonderful.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>Well, since I started using linux- about the start of this year. And I love them! I like how people work together and it has a sense of community rather than &ldquo;here&rsquo;s this stupidly overpriced piece of software and hahaha we don&rsquo;t care about you or your opinions about it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>My boyfriend- he uses it, and got me onto it also. I&rsquo;d hit an art slump and he suggested a change of scenery. It worked.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-take-on-it">What was your first take on it?</h3>
<p>It was weird since I&rsquo;d never swapped from photoshop before and ten years is a long time to be using a piece of software- but it was intuitive enough that I didn&rsquo;t take too long to get used to it. It&rsquo;s the first program that&rsquo;s led me away from PS so you must have done a lot right!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>The brushes. My art instantly improved and stopped having that really glossed over digital look once I started using krita. That&rsquo;s not to say I blame my tools for that- but the brush dynamics let me experiment more and get things looking less plastic. I never really experimented with custom photoshop brushes, so I like that krita just has a set of really amazing ones that come with it instantly. It never occurred to me to use custom photoshop brushes, which sounds dumb to me now but y&rsquo;know&hellip; <strong>~personal growth~</strong> and all that.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>I really really hate the text tool lol. It&rsquo;s really clunky and hard to edit. The brushes also have slight pixelyness to them when resized small, which can be frustrating since I love my small details. But I found a workaround and use the already tiny hard brushes on low opacity. The sharpen tool could have more dynamic controls like gimp and photoshop&rsquo;s one, also. I just duplicate the picture layer, sharpen it and put that layer on a lower opacity since the more customizable sharpen doesn&rsquo;t produce the sort of sharpness I want. I wish I was more helpful on that point, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to explain what I mean. ARGH, WORDS.</p>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>The brushes and the interface, definitely. I also like that it&rsquo;s not bloated like photoshop is. It doesn&rsquo;t have ten trillion things that I&rsquo;ll probably never use. Krita gemini works super well on my surface pro 2, also&ndash; really impressed with it.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</h3>
<p>A really creepy portrait of one of my anthro characters as a human. Kind of. <a href="/images/posts/2014/14.08.21.vaughan...again_.sighsmall.png"><img src="/images/posts/2014/14.08.21.vaughan...again_.sighsmall.png" alt="14.08.21.vaughan&amp;hellip;again.sighsmall"></a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-you-like-about-it-what-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally draw &ldquo;humans&rdquo; (if you&rsquo;d even call him that) and I usually have such a hard time getting my human characters to look right. But I&rsquo;m really proud of his face there.</p>
<p>I also had a blast painting that wall, lol. I love that I can paint stuff like that without textures with the brushes krita has.</p>
<p>I used: block_mix_tilt, hairy_tapered, bristles_tapered, basic_circle_wet, airbrush_linear, splat_mix_cells. Plus aÂ  metric buttload of overlay layers and emboss.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-like-to-share-it-with-our-site-visitors">Would you like to share it with our site visitors?</h3>
<p>Yes! The world needs more nightmare fuel.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>You can find my work and links to everywhere I&rsquo;m a regular at here: <a href="http://www.machinesbleedtoo.com" title="Rose Morgan's site">http://www.machinesbleedtoo.com</a>. I&rsquo;m really easy to stalk, I&rsquo;m that username everywhere. Except for twatter. Damn it&rsquo;s stupid username character limit, hisss hisssssss (I got machinesbleed there instead.) Oh, and, keep being awesome!</p>
