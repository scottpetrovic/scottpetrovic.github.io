<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My name is Enrique Gan. I live in California and I&rsquo;m currently a computer science student.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely just a hobbyist artist but I&rsquo;d like to start making money eventually. But, it&rsquo;s been a while since I studied art for an extended period of time but I&rsquo;d like to get back into it.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/alo1-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I like concept art and anime a lot, but I like to try out different genres and see what I can learn from each one.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>When I first committed a lot of my time to art, it was in 2014 and it was coincidentally also the time when I found a youtube channel of an artist named Sinix. I always thought art was for geniuses only, but after learning about Sinix and his art, I was convinced that anyone can be an artist. His work didn&rsquo;t conform completely to mainstream appeal but I was profoundly captivated by how he draws. Other artists I like included Sachin Teng, Andrew Hem, Kim Jung Gi, Shirow Miwa, Richard Schmidt, and countless others.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/Pizza-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I tried digital painting later in 2014 when I heard that GIMP was a free program and that some artists like CT Chrysler used it. So I tried it out with a mouse but I couldn&rsquo;t do much with it because I was still pretty new to digital painting.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>It lets me store a lot of paintings and export with ease. Also, it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper since I already have a computer and an entry level graphics tablet isn&rsquo;t too expensive compared to buying a lot of paint.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/image2-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>Sycra Yasin posted a video showcasing Krita back in 2013 and I ended up trying it out some time in the summer of 2015. I think I got my first and current drawing tablet a month after and started churning out digital art with Krita since.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>It was a lot more art orientated than GIMP was and it looked very professional like Photoshop.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/tried1-800.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I really like the brush engine and I&rsquo;m really impressed that software of this quality is completely free and open source. I&rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for open source.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I think there are some UI things that confuse just me because I never really read the manual aside from the brush making portion. I don&rsquo;t think I do anything wild either so I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to find many bugs.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019runningout-800png"><img src="images/posts/2019/runningout-800.png" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s free and is catering towards artists. Other free art programs are very simple or restrained but Krita is the whole package.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/red-800.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really liked some of my more recent work like the red girl portrait I did.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I use the most basic brushes imaginable. This includes a horizontal flat brush that doesn&rsquo;t rotate, and another one that rotates. Sometimes I paint with a circle brush that has opacity on pressure. Recently I started using a simple color blending brush called the palette knife. It comes with Krita by default..</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019slephours-800png"><img src="images/posts/2019/slephours-800.png" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I have an instagram, twitter, and artstation all under the name pitganart, as well as a website called pitganart.com. I also have a twitch account where I stream often called PitEG.</p>
