<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is teteotolis. I am a graduate of Athens School of Fine Arts (Greece) and I am a professional illustrator/comic artist/visual artist.</p>
<p>I live in Greece, I eat gyro with suvlaki and I say Opa! sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I am a professional, but I really enjoy drawing and painting for myself too. So both?</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019thor-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2019/thor-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>Mainly illustrations and comics with fantasy and folklore themes.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>First some of my favorite old master painters: Caravaggio, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt, John William Waterhouse, Alphonse Mucha.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite modern day artists: Xavier Houssin, Kevinhogart, Fatemeh Haghnejad, Anninosart, Domnamanolarou, Nefeli_ekati, Kienan Lafferty, Samuelyouart, Ahmed Aldoori, Wlop and David Revoy.</p>
<p>My role models huh? I never thought about it&hellip; I admire a lot of people and their ideals, as well as philosophers, but I don&rsquo;t think that I have a role model&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>In my second year of art school, by myself. I had a potato drawing tablet back then, with no pressure sensitivity!</p>
<p>I did some research, got my first actual tablet and downloaded an actual &ldquo;painting program&rdquo;!</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Reason 1: So I worked with traditional media, oils, acrylics, charcoal, pigments (powder), for all the years (5+2) on my art school. Did you know that most of these things are highly toxic and poisonous? Yeah, turns out that a lot of colors are made by processing heavy metals like cadmium or titanium, others are made by actual poisons like hydrocyanide&hellip; Fun huh? I don&rsquo;t need this on my skin or lungs.</p>
<p>Reason 2: Digital art is instant, convenient, productive and shareable.</p>
<p>Reason 3: It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I still use traditional media from time to time. Traditional art is moreÂ  &ldquo;somatic&rdquo; than digital art (which is more technical): the experience is different. The textures, the feel of touch, the smell of paper, the VIBRANCY of the colors are on a different level.</p>
<p>The accessible technology we have today on monitors, tablets and digital printing has a lot of years ahead to be able to reproduce on monitor or paper what traditional media does with a simple brushstroke.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: Have you ever seen true yellow on a monitor? Or gold? Or true turquoise?</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>Back in April of 2016 I watched a video on youtube, David Revoy painting a little witch &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; something (I love that guy).</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Woah! So this French guy uses this program to paint! It looks so natural! How!? I gotta try this!&hellip; OK, I&rsquo;m here to stay.&rdquo; After that I made my first work on Krita and most of my webcomic &ldquo;<a href="https://tapas.io/series/emery">emery</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019emery1-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2019/emery1-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019emery2jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2019/emery2.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Krita is the best way to transition from traditional art to digital. It&rsquo;s simple, clean, powerful and it has EVERYTHING you&rsquo;ll need for digital illustration. It&rsquo;s the number 1 program that I recommend to my students and my go-to program to use for painterly digital artworks.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>There were some issues in the past, Krita 3 was a nightmare for me and for Wacom Cintiq Companion 2 users in general. (Small layer thumbnails, slow brush rendering, the pallet didn&rsquo;t respond at all, and the transition from pen to eraser was taking 5 seconds to register.) But you swiftly managed to resolve all the issues with the next updates!</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019airspirit-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2019/airspirit-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s powerful, innovative, it&rsquo;s made for digital art (not photo editing), it has one of the best brush engines and&hellip; its free!</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favorite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favorite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2019/circe-800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Circe the enchantress.</p>
<p>I liked the final result a lot, It was inspired by Mucha and I&rsquo;ve won a big art contest thanks to her!</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>Chiaroscuro, a lot of textures and natural looking brushes&hellip;some made by me.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019bitch-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2019/bitch-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>You can find my work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teteotolis_arts/">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/teteotolishttps://www.artstation.com/teteotolishttps://">here</a> aaand <a href="https://teteotolis.com">here</a>! Come say hi!</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I have a webcomic (95% worked in Krita) called &ldquo;emery&rdquo;, take a look! (<a href="https://tapas.io/series/emery">https://tapas.io/series/emery</a>)</p>
