<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with this question from which you may surmise that I&rsquo;m quite introverted or that I&rsquo;m conscious of my tendency to overshare. Both are true. I&rsquo;m a white, heterosexual male but I do keep bees, so…</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Mostly as a hobby unfortunately. My day job is graphic design so I can only paint in the evenings and at weekends but I&rsquo;d love to spend more time doing illustration. One day I’d like to illustrate a children’s book.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consciously work within genres. I guess I&rsquo;m influenced by fantasy, cartoons, horror…I’m not over serious or precious about art. Most of what I do is rather light-hearted (though I do put a serious amount of work into it). I do enjoy dark humour which may be evident in some of my work. I did work as an artist in the games industry for a few years but that was a long time ago when game characters were sixteen by thirty two pixel sprites so really before game art had the chance to develop into what it is today but I do enjoy looking at all the game art on Artstation… check it out if you’re into elfies.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2019/ray-waysider-tree-006-2-800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Perhaps If I&rsquo;d been fanatical about a particular genre I&rsquo;d have devoted the work and effort into developing a style that would fit that genre and been more successful but I have more of a generalist approach, taking influences in an eclectic way from anything that grabs my attention.</p>
<p>I’m not snobby or judgemental about art. I find pleasure in all genres, in fine art and popular culture though I do find the animé/manga style of depicting highly sexualised bodies with prepubescent looking faces morally troubling to say the least..</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>Earliest influences were definitely cartoons, Disney, Warner Bros etc. Then comic books Marvel, DC then album art of the seventies and eighties - people like Roger Dean and Hypgnosis. This sparked an interest in surrealism - Dali, Magritte, Khalo. From there a general interest in art from the Renaissance to Dada. I&rsquo;m as happy studying Goya&rsquo;s etchings as I am getting into Tracy Emin&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2019/ray-waysider-save-20190217-222938-800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Lately I’m into the pulp fiction novel cover art of the 50s but I also admire Illustrators Norman Rockwell, Frazetta, Vallejo and going really old school, Sir John Tenniel, Arthur Rackham and Aubrey Beardsley.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>In the 90s, when I bought my first computer but the lack of a tablet was rather limiting. I remember I&rsquo;d scan pencil drawings and paint over them using the mouse. Drawing with a mouse is like trying to roll a cigarette wearing oily boxing gloves.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>The freedom to adjust just about anything at any stage. Digital painting allows you to be experimental on a piece you&rsquo;ve invested a lot of time in without fear of ruining it by making mistakes. Also no need to clean the brushes.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>Through a YouTube review by the excellent Mr Borodante. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dante88s">https://www.youtube.com/user/dante88s</a></p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>JACKPOT!!!!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>The brush engines and interface makes it easy to edit the brushes. The perspective tools (assistants) are really well designed for artists. I also like how customisable the colour selector is. The multibrush tool is great for rotational symmetry and the wrap-around mode is perfect for creating tiling patterns. Honestly I like pretty much everything!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if you could specify which perspective guide the brush follows more easily. Sometimes if I have guides running at similar angles it snaps to the wrong one. I can disable the one I don’t want, but not as easily as I’d like.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>It’s free (obviously) but apart from that it’s also a very intuitive program. So rich in features and it’s easy to set it up to your own personal taste. I have Photoshop installed on my PC as well as Krita but I just find Krita so comfortable to use and so capable of doing anything I want that I’ve hardly used Photoshop since I installed Krita.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually my last piece, which right now is a painting of a character called Ambrose because on this occasion the finished result is something like what I was originally aiming at when I first conceived the piece. Also people have commented saying it made them feel uncomfortable which pleased me immensely.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use many brushes. Mostly I use a basic brush with pressure sensitive opacity, varying the size with a button on my tablet (I use a GAOMON PD1560 screen monitor). I use the blending brush sparingly and sometimes the soft round airbrush particularly for atmospheric effects. I got the initial reference for the pose in this painting using an android app called easy poser but this was supplemented by quite a few reference images from online and some taken on my phone of my own hands and feet. I do mess around with the filter masks a lot. Particularly the colour adjustment and levels. I also often use a layer set either to multiply or burn to enhance shadows or a layer set to screen or dodge for highlights. I sometimes use a layer set to colour mode to correct or change hues.</p>
