<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I live in Russia, Sochi. Graduated from art school and University with a degree in design. I&rsquo;ve drawn since early childhood. I remember that it was my favorite pastime.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I professionally create logos, and covers for music albums to order. Digital painting on my topics I do not for commerce, but for the soul. Rather, I consider it my real calling, the opportunity to tell something to the world. In this respect I was very inspired by the experience of the French artist David Revoy.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I work in different genres, but I am most attracted to sci-fi and fantasy. Mainly in a realistic presentation.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>As artists in digital art <a href="http://www.theoprins.com/">Theo Prins</a>, <a href="http://shzrebelka.tumblr.com/">Jakub Rebelka</a> and <a href="https://simonstalenhag.se/">Simon St√•lenhag</a> inspire me.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/citadel1-800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I first tried digital painting at school, 17 years ago. I really liked one of the covers of the game Heroes of Might and Magic III. I was was only for drawing). I did not have a graphics tablet, I drew with the mouse, but tried very hard.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I am equally respectful of traditional and digital painting. Although earlier I underestimated digital painting, considering that traditional is more &ldquo;real&rdquo; and alive. Now I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. They simply cannot be compared. But technically I am more comfortable with digital painting, it opens up more opportunities in manipulations with the finished image, it allows you to fully draw in a variety of conditions and places. And most importantly, it allows you to better convey it to the viewer, with help of the network and open licenses.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>By accident! I have not been engaged in digital painting for a long time and a few months ago I decided to return to it. At the same time, I became interested in free software. I started searching the Internet and Krita was one of the first things I found. Decided to try out of curiosity and did not regret it.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I was absolutely ecstatic! Krita brought back my desire to draw in digital painting! First, I bribed the screen saver with a picture of an anime character. Then I started to understand the interface and realized that it was absolutely familiar and understandable to me. Soon I felt that this program was made by artists for artists (I think so).</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Interface. It&rsquo;s very comfortable to navigate the program. I like the basic sets of brushes. Also a great opportunity to edit the picture in color and tone. It is also possible to make animation.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I do not have more extended features of transformation of the elements of the layers. This is not always necessary, so it&rsquo;s a small problem.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Simplicity combined with great features. And versatility.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/city-of-illusions-800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is my first work in Krita, &ldquo;City of Illusions&rdquo;. Simply because it is the first. Also because I had an idea and a sketch for this work for a long time, but I couldn&rsquo;t find the tools and programs to implement them. I think it turned out well in Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I tried many different techniques and brushes, because in this work I mastered the possibilities of the program. Most often I used Chalks, Pencils, Dry Bristles, Dry Brushes and Adjust Color.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>Some of my work can be seen on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sivakov_d/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/dolmensoch278b">Behance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I plan to open a studio, where I will teach people to work in digital painting with Krita, as well as jointly create art projects with my students and like-minded people, to help promote this program.</p>
