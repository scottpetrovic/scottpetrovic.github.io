<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I am a happily married cat mom living in the states, more specifically the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I have played Dungeons and Dragons and other TTRPGs for over a decade and maintain a weekly play schedule to see this day; tabletop games are my passion!</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both-what-genres-do-you-work-in">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both? What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I would say both, though more a hobby than professional. I currently lend my talents to Worldbuilding Magazine, an online and community driven magazine whose mission really resonated with me! I stay working within the realm of fantasy, especially dark or horror fantasy.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>My longtime role model has been <a href="https://donatoarts.com">Donato Giancola</a>, ever since I saw his work in my teens on the cover of the Lord of the Rings trilogy book I&rsquo;d been reading at the time. I also greatly admire <a href="https://www.karlaortizart.com/">Karla Ortiz</a> for her  strength of will and personality - she inspires me all the time to treat others with respect and work my butt off!</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/anna-hannon-deathfinalfinale_800x.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I was in a junior high photography class in which we were able to use old model Wacom tablets for our work. Of course I started drawing with it instead and my professor loved what I did so much he GAVE me his own tablet so I could continue practicing at home. I had that Wacom until I started college years after and upgraded to an Intuos.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like messes!! I feel silly about it but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>It was about three years ago when my main computer quit on me, and I didn&rsquo;t have the cash to buy the updated Windows 10 OS for my new hard drive. I opted for trying Linux Mint, and tested Krita as my Photoshop replacement. Love at first sight! I currently run Manjaro KDE and it continues to be my only painting software (even on my Microsoft surface).</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/anna-hannon-bloodsummoner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>It was a very familiar interface coming from Photoshop. I enjoyed the intuitive UI and the ease of adjusting it to my specifications.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I love the way it looks, I LOVE the brush engine and how much control you have over your brush settings. Also the reference tool??? The best thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I use it constantly.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita">What do you think needs improvement in Krita?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d like a more user friendly text tool but I know that&rsquo;s in the works and gets improved upon often.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2019anna-hannon-mydarian-swamp-final_800xjpg"><img src="images/posts/2019/anna-hannon-mydarian-swamp-final_800x.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Not being able to move my selection outlines across the canvas to use the same shape on another area.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s open source! I donate often but imagine a digital artist just starting out? I know I couldn&rsquo;t have afforded Photoshop without my student discount at the time. I also really love the brush engine.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="images/posts/2019/dana_800x.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I think it would have to be my piece &ldquo;Dana&rdquo; because it was the first painting I&rsquo;d finished in a long time, and it was the first time I felt like I finally understood what I was doing! The lighting came together well, and I actually found myself really loving doing the leather texture on her clothes.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I tried to use a minimal amount of brushes, mostly using the round brush set to pen pressure opacity and a custom brush that is the same but with a little texture. This piece I specifically strove to paint in the textures, yes even the leather on her gauntlets and padded armor.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I have a website at annahannon.com and I also post sometimes on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jedejane">@jedejane</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I have been using Krita as my primary replacement for Photoshop. It has been a rare thing for me to &lsquo;wish for Photoshop&rsquo;. The brushes work great, even on my huge canvas sizes. I really enjoy this software and spread the word everywhere I go. I think the collaborators on this project are doing fantastic work for the community and I support them fully.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking this time to interview me! Love yourself and others, and take care. ￼</p>
