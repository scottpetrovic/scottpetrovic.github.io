<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My full name is Mohammad-Ali Bahabadi, but I sign with my shortened version of my name, Ali Bahabadi. I was born in 1983 in Iran. I got a master&rsquo;s degree in art conservation but I have been working as graphic designer for several years.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>At the moment, I am practicing painting just to increase my artistic abilities. But I am still young enough to become a professional painter. And I think this is a fascinating job.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>In the first place, I want to master realistic portraits of animals. I have always been interested in animals.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2021/1.jpg" alt="Head of a rottweiler dog"></p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>Michelangelo and Da Vinci have always inspired me. Especially Michelangelo. I also find it astonishing how Rembrandt used light in his works. I have also been influenced by a lesser-known Iranian painter named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siyah_Qalam">Mohammad Siah Qalam</a>, who lived in the 14th and 15th centuries. He has strange paintings of imaginary creatures that are very impressive compared to other paintings of his time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artstation.com/aaronblaiseart">Aaron Blaise</a>&rsquo;s paintings also assure me that animals are good subjects for making art.</p>
<p>And a great image-maker that recently I came to know about, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kley">Heinrich Kley</a>. No doubt that he will change my approach to painting. Of course, photographers like <a href="https://www.anseladams.com/">Ansel Adams</a>, <a href="https://www.nickbrandt.com/">Nick Brandt</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> have always inspired me. I have been photographing for many years and even professionally for several years.</p>
<p>All of these are great artists and have had a profound impact on me, but none of them are really my role models.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2021/2.jpg" alt="Head of a young cat"></p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>For the first time, 7 or 8 years ago when I bought a new Wacom graphic tablet. But I really was not very successful at the time. Perhaps I was expecting magic from the digital painting. And since then, except for what I used to draw and to paint on my Android tablet for fun or on a trip, I hadn&rsquo;t taken digital painting seriously. Until my birthday this year, July 25th, 2021, when I made a serious decision to paint digitally. In other words, I&rsquo;m still very new.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>With more speed and possibilities, I can make fundamental changes in my painting at any stage of my work. Also, I paint digitally because of ease of sharing, being cheaper and, of course, I think it would be more favorable for the environment.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I was already familiar with Krita when I was looking for an alternative to Photoshop. I think I even have an old version of Krita on my laptop. And when I decided to take digital painting seriously, my first choice was Krita.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2021/4.jpg" alt="Head of a fox"></p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>Krita had a very pleasant user interface. On the other hand, because I was proficient in Photoshop, I could easily understand the user interface and saw that I could use the same shortcuts. In less than an hour, I felt that, yes, this software was really made for digital painting, and I really felt comfortable with it.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I really like Krita. But when I first realized I could hold down the Shift key and draw my pen on the tablet and see that its size changes, I fell in love with Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>If the selection tools and text tools improve, I may no longer need Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Krita is free and easily accessible. This is great. But I think focusing on digital painting makes it fantastic.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>Maybe this cat.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/2021/5.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2021/5.jpg" alt="Head and part of the torso of a fluffy white cat"></a></p>
<p>Two weeks before I drew this cat, I had drawn a cat which I think was awful. The next week I drew another cat and left it half-finished, and I drew another cat and tried to hide its flaws under its fur. But it was not good either. So I decided to draw only cats every day for at least a week. And after a week I drew this and I was almost satisfied with it (please see my progress in drawing this cat in the photos below). <a href="/images/posts/2021/improvment-in-a-week.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2021/improvment-in-a-week.jpg" alt="Progress pictures of cat drawing"></a></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a timelapse:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I tried different brushes. But I feel more comfortable with those brushes that mimic pencils and charcoal. But I also try to use the other brushes if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>This is my website address: <a href="https://www.bahabadi.com">bahabadi.com</a></p>
<p>I am also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHv_hNLkxqlcY20MwVyayfw">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ali.bahabadi">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bahabadi/">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I am new to digital painting, but I think that digital painting has made it easier for me to paint, and in a short time it has made me a better artist. Although this change might be small, I can easily feel it myself. Almost every day I paint a new painting, which I believe it is not so easy be achieved in the traditional way. I need to thank everyone who contributed to the development of Krita. I have had the possibility of digital painting for many years. I had both a good graphic tablet and the most expensive graphic software available to me. But I think there was something in Krita that encouraged me to paint every day. Krita has a friendly spirit that accompanies me in painting.</p>
