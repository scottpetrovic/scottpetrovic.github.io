<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Yes certainly! I&rsquo;m Lars Pontoppidan; a 36 year old, self-employed programmer, game developer, musician and artist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawing and painting since I could put my pen to the paper - so about 35 years.</p>
<p>I made my first recognizable painting when I was around 3 or 4 - my mom still has it framed at her house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to end up at some level where I could combine all my skills and hobbies. Somewhere along the way I found out that game development demand a lot of the skills I possess - so 1.5 years ago, I decided to cancel all my contracts with my clients and go for a new path in life as &ldquo;indie game developer&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve now found out that it&rsquo;s probably the worst time I could ever get into indie game development. The bubble has more or less already burst. There&rsquo;s simply too many game releases for the consumers to cope with at the moment. But hey I&rsquo;ve tried worse so it doesn&rsquo;t really bother me - and I get to make art with Krita!</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Both I&rsquo;d say. I&rsquo;ve always been creating things on a hobby level - but have also delivered a lot of designs, logos and custom graphics as self-employed. I like the hobby work the most - as there are no deadlines or rules for when the project is done.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/c_front.png" alt="">Cartooning, Digital painting, Animation and Video game art. All these (and maybe more) blend in when producing a game. I also like painting dark and gloomy pictures once in a while.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve mostly done cartoon styled work - but with a grain of realism in it. My own little mixture.</p>
<p>I started out with pencil and paper - moved to the Deluxe Paint series, when I got my first Amiga - and ended up with Krita (which is an absolute delight to work with. Thanks to you guys!). I still occasionally do some sketching with pencil and paper - depending on my mood.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>* A list too long for me to compile here, of sci-fi fantasy artists. Peter Elson is the first that comes to mind. These artists, in my opinion, lay the very foundation of what&rsquo;s (supposedly) possible with human technology - and currently, the only possibility to get a glimpse of how life might look like other places in the vast universe that surrounds us. It&rsquo;s mind blowing how they come up with all the alien designs they do.</p>
<p>* Salvador Dal√≠ - It&rsquo;s hard to find the right words for his creations - which, I think, is why his works speak to me.</p>
<p>* &ldquo;vergvoktre&rdquo; He&rsquo;s made some really dark, twisted and creepy creations that somehow get under my skin.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>The very first digital painting program I&rsquo;ve ever tried was KoalaPainter for the Commodore 64. I had nothing but a joystick and made, if I recall correctly, a smiley face in black and white.</p>
<p>Thankfully my Amiga 500 came with a copy of Deluxe Paint IV, a two-button mouse and the luxury of a 256+ color palette.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>The glorious &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; buffer. I mean&hellip; It&rsquo;s just magic.Especially in the first part of the day (before the first two cups of coffee) where your hand just won&rsquo;t draw perfect circles, nor any straight lines.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I read an article about the Calligra office suite online. It described how Calligra compared to Open Office. I eventually installed it to see how it compared to Open Office and boom there was Krita as part of the package. This was my first encounter - unfortunately it ended up with an uninstall - because of stability issues with the Calligra suite in general.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>The first impression was actually really good - unfortunately it ended up a bit in the shadows of the Calligra suite&rsquo;s combined impression. This wasn&rsquo;t so positive after a few segfaults in the different applications. Luckily I tried Krita later when it entered the Qt5 based versions. I haven&rsquo;t looked back since.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/Typical_layer_setup.png" alt="">The brush engines and the &ldquo;Layers&rdquo; docker.</p>
<p>The brushes, and most of the default settings for them, just feel right. Also the many options to tweak the brushes are really awesome.</p>
<p>The layers docker was actually what gave me the best impression of the program - you had working group layers - and you could give any layer the same names! None of the graphic creation applications I used a few years back had these basic, fundamental features <em>done right</em> (Inkscape and GIMP - I&rsquo;m looking at you). Krita&rsquo;s layers didn&rsquo;t feel somewhat broken, hacked-on and had no naming scheme limitations. A small thing that has made a big difference to me.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Uhm&hellip; I was going to write &lsquo;speed&rsquo; - but everybody is screaming for more of that already. I know how the developers are doing their best to get more juice.</p>
<p>Some great overall stability would be nice. I&rsquo;ve only ever had 2 or 3 crashes with GIMP over a long period of time - the count is a bit higher with Krita - on a shorter time scale.</p>
<p>My biggest feature request would be: Cut&rsquo;n&rsquo;paste functionality <em>through</em> multiple layers, that also paste in separate layers. This would greatly improve my workflow. I&rsquo;ve always worked with a group layer containing separate layers for outline, color, texture, shadow etc. - on each e.g. movable part in a character rig. So I would really benefit from a (selection based) cut&rsquo;n&rsquo;paste that could cut through all the selected layers - and paste all these separate selection+layers elsewhere in the layer tree.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I find that most of Krita&rsquo;s tools actually do what you expect them to do - without any weird limitations or special cases. Plus the different brushes, brush engines and all the flexibility to tweak them, are real killer features.</p>
<p>The non-destructive masks (Transparency, Filter and Transform) are also on my list of favourite features. I use these layer types a lot when creating game art - to make them blend in better with the game backgrounds.</p>
<p>And maybe the single most important thing: it&rsquo;s free and open source. So I&rsquo;m quite certain I will be able to open up my old Krita files many years into the future.</p>
<p>&hellip; and speaking of the future; I really look forward to getting my hands dirty with the Python scripting API.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/day_night.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It would have to be the opening scene of my upcoming 2D game &ldquo;non&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s using a great variety of Krita&rsquo;s really awesome and powerful features. The scenes in the game features full day and night cycles where all the lighting and shadows change dynamically - this makes it especially hard to get beautiful <em>painted</em> scenes in all the states each scene has between day and night. Krita&rsquo;s tool set makes it easier and quicker for me to test out a specific feature for an object or sprite - before throwing it into the game engine.</p>
<p>The biggest scene I have so far is 10200x4080 pixels - Krita was actually performing decently up to a certain point where I had to break the scene into smaller projects. I&rsquo;m not blaming Krita for this :-)</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>For cartoon styled work I use a Group layer containing: * background blend (Transparency Mask) * shadows (Paint layer) * outlines (Paint layer) * textures (Group layer) * solid base color(s) (Paint layer)</p>
<p>For outlines I use the standard Pixel brush &lsquo;Ink_gpen_10&rsquo; - it has a really nice sharp edge at small tip sizes. For texturing I mostly use the &lsquo;Splatter_thin&rsquo; Pixel brush - with both standard and custom brush tips and settings depending on the project at hand. For shadowing I really like the &lsquo;Airbrush_pressure&rsquo; and &lsquo;Airbrush_linear_noisy&rsquo; Pixel brushes. I use a selection mask based on the solid base color layer (Layer name -&gt; Right mouse click -&gt; Select Opaque) - and start shadowing the object.</p>

<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone involved with Krita for making this great open source and free software available to the world. I hope to soon get enough time on my hands to help the project grow.</p>
<p>Take care and be nice to each other.</p>
