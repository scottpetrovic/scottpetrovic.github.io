<p>Hi! My name is Emily Wei, and I&rsquo;m 19 years old. I was born in Taiwan, but I grew up in New Jersey. Right now, I&rsquo;m back in Taiwan juggling university, freelance work, sleep, and a one-year course I&rsquo;m taking at Kadokawa International Edutainment (Advanced Commercial Illustration).</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I suppose I&rsquo;d be considered a hobbyist as of now since I&rsquo;m not making money off art yet, but I aim to do it professionally in the near future!</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>My main love is in illustration, but a lot of the things I&rsquo;ve been working on lately fall under concept design, so things like characters and 2D game assets, among others. Stylewise, I&rsquo;m somewhere between anime, fantasy/RPG video games, and emotional surrealism. Basically, I&rsquo;m kind of all over the place since I&rsquo;m trying different things to get a feel for what my likes and dislikes are; I&rsquo;ve recently fallen in love with doing background illustrations, for example!</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s really tough; there are too many! Pretty much everyone I&rsquo;m following on Twitter/DeviantArt/Artstation, masters like Sargent and Mucha as well as my friends and mentors.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I think I was about 9 or 10 when I started? I was a hardcore Neopets user at the time, and at some point, I stumbled upon the art community there. That led to me discovering How to Draw ____ in Photoshop tutorials by an artist I really looked up to (shameless plug: her social media handle name is droidnaut across various platforms! Do check her out ^^)</p>
<p>It really amazed me how versatile digital art was, and I&rsquo;ve never stopped since.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Short version: CTRL+Z!</p>
<p>Long version: Digital art is much more forgiving than traditional medias, and you don&rsquo;t really need to keep buying art supplies (not counting Adobe CC subscriptions, hardware upgrades, plugins, etc.) There are a lot of tools you can use that save you a boatload of time, and it&rsquo;s easier to make changes to your work as needed.</p>
<p>That said, I do love traditional art. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the feeling of putting pen on paper! It&rsquo;s also easier in some aspects; for example, drawing decent circles (and most geometric shapes in general) freehand is ridiculously harder with a tablet. Limited supplies also makes you be more economic and decisive about what goes where, which is a mindset I&rsquo;d like to carry over into my digital work more.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/web_waytooemily_odow_levi_umi2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember, actually! I think I might&rsquo;ve seen a thread about it on Neopets or a post on tumblr. It was some time after the Kickstarter for Krita 3.0 ended, and the &ldquo;faster than Photoshop&rdquo; part of the campaign despite all the tools the program offered had me intrigued.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! This is almost just like Photoshop!&rdquo; The UI is very similar, haha.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>The brush engines are really fantastic. There are a lot of traditional media-esque brushes for people who like a little roughness/texture as well as the standard digital round opacity brushes and soft airbrushes. Here&rsquo;s one of the first few sketches I did with Krita back in 2015:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/web_waytooemily_klk_satsuki_adolescent.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the option to convert your artwork to CMYK if you want to make prints and merch, which is really convenient.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I suppose my only qualm is that the text tool and I don&rsquo;t really seem to get along, haha. Text input and changing the font size is oddly challenging. It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, though.</p>
<p>This might have changed in version 3, but I&rsquo;m still using version two-point-something since my computer can&rsquo;t quite handle the newest version.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I find it amazing how much you can do with a program that is legitimately free to download! It&rsquo;s basically Photoshop condensed down to just the tools and functions a CG illustrator would use. I think this is especially nice for people who are new to digital art since they can get into it without putting a huge dent into your wallet (or pirating :-) ).</p>
<p>And again, the brushes are great.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2017kritabrushesjpeg"><img src="/images/posts/2017/kritabrushes.jpeg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>Probably &ldquo;No&rdquo;!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2017/20170911_web_waytooemily_no.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the most technically advanced work I&rsquo;ve done, and the story behind it isn&rsquo;t exactly happy, but I still like the colors, the clothing folds, and the overall composition.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember what brushes I used, actually! I do have a favorite brushes preset, though, so they&rsquo;re probably among them.</p>
<p>As for techniques, nothing super fancy beyond simple digital painting and blending.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>

<p>Feel free to follow me, come say hi, ask me questions, whatever! I&rsquo;m most active on Twitter, Tumblr, and Plurk.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m still in the process of updating my Facebook page, Artstation, and Instagram, so hopefully there will be things for you to look at there by the time you read this.)</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, people always say how tools do not a craftsman make, and the same thing is true with digital art. The most expensive programs and tablets in the world will not make you a master overnight, nor do you need them to make art. Explore different options (like Krita!), learn as much as you can, and just have fun with it :D</p>
