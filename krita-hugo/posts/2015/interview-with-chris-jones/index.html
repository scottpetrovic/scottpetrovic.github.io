<p>I live in Melbourne, Australia, and have worked as an illustrator, concept artist, matte painter and 3D artist on a variety of print, game, film and TV projects. I&rsquo;m probably best known for my short animated film The Passenger, and my on-going 3D human project.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>Mostly professionally, but I&rsquo;m hoping to work up some more personal pieces soon.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I dabbled with Logo and Mouse Paint when I was a kid in the 1980s, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1996 that I was able to properly migrate my drawing and painting skills to the digital domain when I bought a Wacom tablet and Painter 4. I&rsquo;ve barely touched a pencil or paintbrush ever since.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Undo, redo and being able to revert to earlier versions; the freedom to experiment as much as I want without wasting expensive art materials; being able to use and create tools that don&rsquo;t exist in reality; not needing any physical storage space (other than a hard drive); being able to back-up the originals without any loss of quality; no waiting for paint to dry, dealing with a clogged airbrush, wrestling with Frisket and getting paint fumes up my nose &hellip; need I go on? :)</p>
<p>I must admit though, I do miss perusing all the nice tools and materials in the art shop.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how I first found out about them, but it must have been sometime soon after I started using the internet in 1996. I was a bit puzzled as to what would possess people to give their commercially viable software away for free, with no strings attached.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m using such software, I find that I have a more direct influence on the shape and direction of the tools I use, which provides me with incentive to contribute, and probably helps explain some of the driving force behind these communities.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>Krita is the only one I&rsquo;ve been involved with in any way so far, other than Blender, which I&rsquo;ve only skimmed the surface of.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I first came across it a few years ago when I was looking for a replacement for my aging copy of Painter 8, but at the time it was either too uncooked or simply unavailable on Windows. In early 2013 I saw it mentioned in a forum discussion about Photoshop alternatives, so I thought I&rsquo;d take another look.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>It was still early on in its Windows development at the time so it was full of bugs and highly unstable, but despite this I was pleasantly surprised to find that feature-wise it compared favourably with Painter 8 (which itself was pretty buggy anyway), and even gave Painter 12 a run for its money. It was like a version of Painter with all the bloat stripped out, and some long-standing fundamental issues and omissions finally addressed.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>The pop-up menu; flexible UI; transform and assistant tools; a plethora of colour blending modes; mirror modes; being able to flip the image instantaneously using the &ldquo;m&rdquo; key; being able to convert the currently selected brush into an eraser using the &ldquo;e&rdquo; key; undo history; layers that behave predictably; responsive developers who engage frequently and openly with users; the rapid pace of development; and of course an ongoing stream of free upgrades!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>Nothing I&rsquo;m particularly hateful about - mainly I&rsquo;d like to see speed improvements, particularly when using large brushes and large images. I think I heard some murmurings about progress in that area though. Changing the layer order can also be quite sluggish, amongst other things. Stability is getting pretty good now, although there&rsquo;s still room for improvement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve accumulated a list of niggles and requests that I&rsquo;ll get around to verifying/reporting one of these days&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Most apps feel like they&rsquo;re designed for someone else, and I have to try and adapt to their workflow. Krita feels more like it was built with me in mind, and whenever I feel something should behave differently, someone is usually already on the case before I even make mention of it. As far as 2D software goes, Krita fits my needs better than any of the alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Krita has infiltrated my 3D work as well (which can be found at <a href="http://www.chrisj.com.au" title="Chris Jones' website">www.chrisj.com.au</a>), and it&rsquo;s proven to be well suited to editing textures, as well as painting them from scratch. I look forward to using it more extensively in this area.</p>
