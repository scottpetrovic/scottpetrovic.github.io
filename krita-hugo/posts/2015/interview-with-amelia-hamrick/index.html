<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My name is Amelia Hamrick, and I&rsquo;m a junior music and fine arts double major at Oklahoma Christian University. I&rsquo;m actually working towards a masters in library science, but I&rsquo;d like to get into illustration, concept art and webcomics on the side!</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still an art student but I hope to work on a professional level. I definitely draw a lot for fun outside of classwork though, so both!</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>Fantasy and sci-fi mostly, though I dabble in other genres!</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>Hmm&hellip; In no particular order, Hiromu Arakawa, Mike Mignola, Hayao Miyazaki, Maurice Noble, Bill Watterson, Roy Lichtenstein, Alphonse Mucha&hellip; There&rsquo;s too many to list!</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I started out trying to color ink drawings in GIMP with a mouse! That never turned out very well, haha. I talked my parents into getting me a little wacom bamboo tablet for Christmas when I was in&hellip; 9th grade, I think?</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Layers, ctrl-Z, and transform tools, hahaha! I still do a lot of traditional work (I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed working with gouache) but most of my not-schoolwork art is done digitally now.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I used to go on occasional Google search sprees for all the latest drawing applications, and I found Krita during one of these about 3 or 4 years ago. My old computer couldn&rsquo;t handle the windows build, though, and I hadn&rsquo;t really gotten into Linux yet&hellip; I run ubuntuGNOME on my school-provided Macbook now, so I tried Krita again last year when it was just entering version 2.8, and I&rsquo;ve used it ever since!</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>When I tried it for the very first time on an old computer it looked really impressive, but it was just too much for that poor old box, haha. Krita&rsquo;s performance has improved tremendously!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>It combines just about all the features of Photoshop that I&rsquo;d use with a more streamlined interface, a MUCH better brush engine (loving the color blending and pressing E for erasing with any tool,) stroke smoothing and canvas mirroring like Paint Tool SAI&hellip; The feature I take most for granted, though, is the right-click preset palette!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I would really love to see a more stable OS X build, as I often try to convince my fellow art students to give Krita a shot but they mostly use OS X and are wary of trying experimental builds. Other than that, the software in its current state is fantastic and I&rsquo;m really excited for the new features the Kickstarter will bring (especially the animation tools and gradient map!)</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve already answered this, but it combines features from several different painting programs I&rsquo;ve tried into one killer app! It&rsquo;s the only program where I haven&rsquo;t felt like I&rsquo;m missing anything from my workflow. And being open-source is the cherry on top!</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>This poster that I drew for a friend of a scene from her Pathfinder character&rsquo;s backstory is the most ambitious project I&rsquo;ve completed in Krita! She won her magical flying-V guitar in a shredding duel with a punk rock demon&hellip; how can I pass that mental image up?</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I used primarily the ink pen with the tilt function (ink_tilt_20) and the hairy brush (bristles_hairy). I sketched and inked first of course, then painted everything in greyscale on one layer and colored on top of that with an overlay layer! I also used the perspective guides quite liberally (though I hadn&rsquo;t yet figured out how to properly use the ruler assistants, haha)</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I have <a href="http://ameliadrawsthings.tumblr.com" title="Amelia Draws Things">an art blog on tumblr</a>, and I&rsquo;m working on getting a proper portfolio website set up!</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone involved in developing Krita! I wish I could help code&hellip; maybe I can volunteer with updating the user manual!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also currently doing <a href="http://ameliadrawsthings.tumblr.com/post/118341356484/chaoscontrolled123-im-opening-commissions-for" title="Get a sketch from Amelia!">sketch commissions to help fund the Krita kickstarter</a>!</p>
