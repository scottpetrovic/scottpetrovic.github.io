<p>My name is Andrei Rudenko, I&rsquo;m a freelance illustrator, graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts (as a painter) in Chisinau (Moldova). I have many hobbies, I like icon/UI design, photography, learned a few programming languages and make games in my spare time, and also have about 10 releases on musical labels as 2R. For now I&rsquo;m trying to improve my skills in illustration and game development.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Both, it is good when your hobby is your job.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I like surrealism, critical realism. I don&rsquo;t care about genre much, I think the taste and culture in art is more important.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>I really like the Renaissance artists, Russian Wanderers, also Jacques-Louis David, Caravaggio, Anthony van Dyck, and Roberto Ferri.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-you-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When did you try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I think about 2010, trying to paint in Photoshop but I didn&rsquo;t like that to draw with, and I left it until I found Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Digital painting has its advantages, speed, tools, ctrl+z. For me it is a place for experiments, which I can then use in traditional painting.Â­</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>When I became interested in Linux and open source. I found Krita, it had everything that I needed for a digital painting. For me it is important to repeat that feeling like you paint using traditional materials.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>As soon as I discovered a powerful brush engine. I realized that this is what I was looking for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I like its tools, as I have already said the brush engine, the large variety of settings. I like the team who are developing Krita, very nice people. And of course it is free.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I think better vector graphics tools, for designers. Also make some fixes for pixel art artists.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>The possibility to customize it the way you like.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>Monk for Diablo 3 contest, there is a lot of work and a lot that needs to be done. But Krita gave me everything i needed to make this art.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>Most of the time I use the color smudge brush (with dulling), like in traditional oil painting. For details a simple circle brush, for leaves I made a special brush with scattering. Almost all brushes I made myself, and also patterns for brushes I made from my texture photos.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
