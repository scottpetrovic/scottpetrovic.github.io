<h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Abbigail Ward. I am a published illustrator and fine art student.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>I have been drawing as a hobby since I was little but just started doing professional art work in the past couple of years. My first published book <a href="http://mossfamilybooks.com/" title="Moss Family Books">Monster Parade, written by Gregory Moss,</a> came out in January, so that&rsquo;s exciting! Besides that I have been doing small projects like character portraits and album covers.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I first started digital painting around 9 years ago when my mother bought me a small Wacom tablet for Christmas. I loved that tablet, still have it in fact! Though I use a different tablet now. If I remember correctly, I believe it was digital art on <a href="http://elfwood.com" title="Elfwood Fantasy and Sci fi Art">elfwood.com</a> that first made me want to try digital painting. I&rsquo;ve always loved fantasy art.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I choose digital over traditional. I am actually going to college for fine arts at the moment and I love both. I will say that I find digital to be a better fit for my illustration work. It&rsquo;s cheaper and faster and tends to translate better for printing. I also like the experimenting that I can do painting digitally. If I learn how to do something traditionally, I like to see if I can imitate that same technique on the computer. For instance I made a tutorial on how to make a drawing that looks like a pencil drawing. That was fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say exactly how I first heard of them. But I think they are wonderful! While I have used some FOSS for a few years now, I am still new to learning about the communities themselves. I wish I could do more to contribute, myself, but I don&rsquo;t know what I could do.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t contributed to any FOSS projects though I do try to spread the word about the programs I use and have started trying to make tutorials on how I make my art using them.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I found out about Krita through <a href="http://davidrevoy.com" title="David Revoy's illustration portfolio">David Revoy</a> and looking for alternatives to Corel Painter.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>Since it was a few years ago it was slow for me since I was using Krita on an old Windows laptop. Even then I loved it.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I feel like Krita is the closest fit to what I want in a program. It lets me imitate traditional media or have a more digital look without having to switch programs. A lot of the new features released in 2.9 make it even more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>Hrm, most of what I would want to see improved has already been listed as future goals. The main improvement I would want to see would probably be the text box feature. That way I could edit the text without having to go to a different program.</p>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Krita really is more focused to creating images from scratch without being chained to imitating traditional media as close to possible. I&rsquo;ve tried quite a few programs, but Krita is the program that works the best for me, maybe because I like both traditional and digital media.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really pick a favourite picture. But I have plenty of pictures made with Krita in <a href="http://lady-dragonrose.deviantart.com/gallery/" title="Gallery on deviantart">my gallery</a>. I think if I had to choose one picture to share it might beÂ  &ldquo;<a href="http://lady-dragonrose.deviantart.com/art/Mountains-511480154" title="Mountains (on deviantart)">Mountains</a>&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s my newest finished work.</p>
<h3 id="what-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>For that one I used mostly the bristle, knife/flat brushes, and added a canvas texture.</p>
<h3 id="would-you-like-to-share-it-with-our-site-visitors">Would you like to share it with our site visitors?</h3>
<p>Anyone is free to use it since I uploaded it with a Creative Commons license.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Thanks for being awesome!</p>
