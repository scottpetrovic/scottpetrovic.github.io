<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hello, I am a young woman who is passionate about colorful art and details. My addiction to details is a dominant feature in my artwork.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Well, I see drawing as a hobby only. That&rsquo;s because I need a clear &ldquo;border&rdquo; between working life and free time. I admit it.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I would say that my art style is unique. It&rsquo;s difficult for me to describe my style. I would say that my artwork is most closely to naive art. Naive art&rsquo;s characteristics are colorful, detailed and simplistic. It also ignores the rules of perspective.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>I have many influences. My most important sources of inspiration are naive and folk art paintings, simplistic cartoons and books about art techniques. I&rsquo;ve never had formal art training because I see drawing as a hobby only.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I bought my Wacom graphics tablet in late 2014. I wanted to try something different and that was the reason I started digital painting at that time.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>Digital painting is inexpensive to me because of this forgiving nature. You cannot mess up a picture in digital art because you can start over and over. I love digital painting for this reason.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I painted my very first digital artwork with GIMP. But soon, GIMP was too complicated for digital painting for me. I searched for free GIMP alternatives. After hours of searching, I found Krita and I downloaded it.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It looks and feels very professional but it is for free. WOW!&rdquo; I thought.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I love Krita because it is professional in the look and feel but it is for free. I also like the large amount of digital painting brushes in Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>I like Krita very much but the perspective grid tools could be easier to handle. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>Krita is better for digital painting than other tools. Other software is more focused on image manipulation. And I don&rsquo;t use closed source painting programs because they are very expensive.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>One of my most favorite Krita paintings is &ldquo;Three Little Dresses&rdquo;. This digital painting shows my addiction to naive and colorful art very well. It is also focused on details.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I have used three kinds of brushes: basic tip, sponge texture and circle filling. I use these brushes most frequently in my digital paintings.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I have a few social network accounts for publishing my best artworks. But my most important account is on DeviantArt. Here is the link to my art on DeviantArt: <a href="http://www.serenitywing.deviantart.com">www.serenitywing.deviantart.com</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Thank you for the great efforts on the development of Krita!</p>
