<h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Lucas and I&rsquo;m a 3D artist, I&rsquo;ve been working professionally with 3D for about 6 years now. Mostly doing modeling and texturing tasks, but sometimes shading and lighting too. Besides this professional side, I like to be with friends, ride my bicycle, practice guitar, read and  taste new vegan foods.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>The closest I get to painting is to paint textures for 3D models, I do that professionally. I started using Krita recently at the studio where I work for some tasks, and also started using it for my personal projects. I use Krita to put together baked maps that I create in Blender, also for painting textures and improve maps.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just started learning digital first. When I was studying at the college, by the way, I graduated in Design. There, at the college, I learned some graphic programs and 3D, so I started to practice in digital, but I also learned traditional art/design theory there. I never tried modeling in clay, sometimes I draw on paper, that&rsquo;s usually the closest I get to traditional. But I&rsquo;ve always studied traditional theory.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s was when I started using Blender and I found them really great. It&rsquo;s an awesome environment to learn, people are always sharing files, techniques with each other. And there is also a lot of tutorials for free and a lot of tutorials for a very affordable price.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never worked on a FOSS project, but I really like to someday work in one, like an open movie.  I make a monthly donation to Blender Foundation and I&rsquo;m subscribed in the Blender Cloud, which is one of the ways that the BF is financing the Project Gooseberry. I also made a donation to the Kickstarter to accelerate Krita&rsquo;s development. ;)</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but I&rsquo;m almost pretty sure it was by a video shared by that awesome artist, David Revoy, showing some features of Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I was amazed by the features and tools that I see. I found the interface very professional and the software comes with a lot of awesome brushes.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Krita has a lot of tools that I love to see in image editor/painting software, like for example the wrap around mode, the mirror mode, instanced layers, the transform and warp tools are pretty awesome too. Among other tools.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>I think Krita is doing great and I really like the direction it&rsquo;s going, the software it seems to be made for artists, at least I have this impression when I use the tools to work on the creation and painting of textures. I don&rsquo;t hate anything in Krita, and I don&rsquo;t use all the tools, but I think usability could always be improved.</p>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the very good combination between image editor and painting in one package, and some awesome tools that I haven&rsquo;t seen before in other software.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Thank you for inviting me for this interview and a big thanks to Krita development team for doing a great work on the software. Keep it up!</p>
