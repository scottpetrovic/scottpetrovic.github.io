<h3 id="would-you-like-to-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Would you like to tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I like cinema and I like to draw motion pictures. I do not like very much to draw static pictures but I can. I studied traditional painting for eight years in the art school and after that I&rsquo;ve continued to do it myself for 36 years. I like to learn painting even more than to paint.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-or-as-a-hobby-artist">Do you paint professionally or as a hobby artist?</h3>
<p>I work in the small animation studio as a 2D-3D artist. I draw storyboards and backgrounds in 2D. I make the full 3D film work: modelling, texturing, lighting, rigging and animation. I have very little time to paint personal works, unfortunately.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-how-did-you-end-up-trying-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">When and how did you end up trying digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>It was terrific! I was scanning the black ink drawings on the paper and colouring them in Photoshop in 1996. It was my black-and-white comics for the regional newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What is it that makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>The choice is simple. No need to buy oil paints and squirrel brushes, it is so lazy. Laziness is the engine of technological progress.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/2015/evolve.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2015/evolve800.jpg" alt="evolve800"></a></p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-first-find-out-about-open-source-communities-what-is-your-opinion-about-them">How did you first find out about open source communities? What is your opinion about them?</h3>
<p>When I found out about Krita I wrote to Boudewijn Rempt and he answered! It was cool!</p>
<h3 id="have-you-worked-for-any-foss-project-or-contributed-in-some-way">Have you worked for any FOSS project or contributed in some way?</h3>
<p>I have no such experience yet and I have no ability to do that at the present day but I would like do it in the future.</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>My favourite artists are Titian and Moebius (Jean Giraud). When the developers dedicated the another edition of Krita to Moebius I was interested in this and looked at Krita.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>Krita is my favourite 2D package and I would like to do something for its development.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-also-anything-that-you-really-hate">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Also, anything that you really hate?</h3>
<p>There is nothing to hate in Krita. I hate myself for that I can&rsquo;t convince Boud to do what I want and not what he wants:)</p>
<h3 id="volcano800imagesposts2015volcano800jpgimagesposts2015volcanojpg"><a href="/images/posts/2015/volcano.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2015/volcano800.jpg" alt="volcano800"></a></h3>
<h3 id="in-your-opinion-what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">In your opinion, what sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I like to write to Mr. Rempt and to Mr. Kazakov and I like how they answer.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any favourites yet.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it-that-you-like-about-it-what-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What is it that you like about it? What brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I like Smooth Zoom Tool, Wrap Around Mode and Mirror View. I use the standard brushes: Ink_brush_25, Airbrush_linear, Block_tilt, Basic_circle, Bristles_hairy, Basic_mix_soft. I make animated texture brushes and rotate them during painting manually.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>Unfortunatelly I cannot share all my professional works to public. It is just because they are owned by the customers of Irkutsk small animation studio Forsight. I can do it a bit on some sites: <a href="http://megayustas.deviantart.com">http://megayustas.deviantart.com</a>, <a href="http://ascomix.narod.ru">http://ascomix.narod.ru</a> and <a href="http://igor-leskov.livejournal.com">http://igor-leskov.livejournal.com</a>.</p>
