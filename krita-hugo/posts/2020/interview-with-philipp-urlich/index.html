<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Switzerland and have studied art and graphic design in 90'.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hobby but I&rsquo;m happy to be able to do some commissions for an RPG book lately, and I got several projects to work on in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>My main focus currently are fantasy environments. But I also do character design and love to paint dragons.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2020old-man-and-the-dragon-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2020/old-man-and-the-dragon-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s many artists I&rsquo;m inspired by. For example Bierstadt for his romantic landscape. Also all the Russian landscape artists like Schischkin and many more. Frank Frazetta and MÃ¶bius. Of course there&rsquo;s so many other old master artists throughout the history I can&rsquo;t list them all. I also admire the work of A. Rocha, who is a young artist that has a similar style. There&rsquo;s so many awesome artists to get inspired by and thanks to the internet it&rsquo;s easy to see their work.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I think it was in 1997, when I got my first Wacom Intuos2. I didn&rsquo;t really get into it and had other interests at that time. In 2010 I picked it up again for some portraits I was doing videos of, but lost interest again. It&rsquo;s only in Feb 2019 where I really started again more serious with a mission in mind.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>The flexibility and being able to produce things not possible or very hard in traditional. I don&rsquo;t have an atelier and the resources to paint traditionally.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2020the-cataclysm-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2020/the-cataclysm-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>Since I was not keen on using Photoshop for painting (even though I worked for many years with Photoshop), I was looking for alternatives. Then I finally found Krita in 2018.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>I was surprised, how many features and tools it had. The brush engines are very powerful and the UI seemed intuitive enough.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>I love that it&rsquo;s open source. It has many great tools for various tasks. The ability to create your own powerful brushes. I also love that you can do animations.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2020rugged-domain-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2020/rugged-domain-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>Performance can always be improved and it&rsquo;s a very important one. Though Krita has made some big leaps in that regard. I&rsquo;m often working on greater resolutions with tons of layers, and it can get somewhat laggy depending on the amount of things you put in.</p>
<p>Stability. There&rsquo;s some parts where Krita crashes sometimes when it comes to vector tools. Though it&rsquo;s not its main focus, it&rsquo;s still annoying when you want to experiment with things and it won&rsquo;t let you.</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>It has a great community, not only the users but also the developers are awesome. I was able to chat with a developer (Wolthera) to talk about color management in Krita. The developers care and are putting lots of work into making it a better program.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people like Ramon Miranda who puts a lot of effort into making top notch brushes and cares a lot about the community.</p>
<p>The software lets you do your work and doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. Easy to use yet very powerful.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-sofar-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita sofar, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2020/the-source-800.jpg" alt="">I think it has to be my latest painting to date. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oOLPoz">The Source</a>&rdquo;. It was done completely live on stream over 3 days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavily inspired by A. Bierstadt and I think I pushed myself a little further (like I try every time on a painting like this)</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>This one is special as it was done with mainly only the default round brush opaque with size and opaque on pressure.</p>
<p>The technique is somehow comparable to painting in oil. I used a lot of layers while having the background shine through. I switch between painting and eraser a lot.</p>
<h3 id="imagesposts2020mirath-800jpg"><img src="/images/posts/2020/mirath-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p><a href="https://artstation.com/somartist">https://artstation.com/somartist</a></p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I want to thank all the people that made Krita possible. You guys are awesome.</p>
<p>I like to tell other artists to try Krita. I hope to inspire other people to do artwork too.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
