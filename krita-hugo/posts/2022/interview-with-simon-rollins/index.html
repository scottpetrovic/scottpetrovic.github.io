<h3 id="could-you-tell-us-something-about-yourself">Could you tell us something about yourself?</h3>
<p>My full name is Simon Sterling Rollins. Most people call me Simon. I was born in July 2005 in the state of Georgia. I&rsquo;m autistic. I&rsquo;m still in high school, but during my free time I draw artworks to share with the world.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-paint-professionally-as-a-hobby-artist-or-both">Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3>
<p>Right now, I am trying to improve my work. In 2019 I was gifted a Wacom tablet for Christmas, and I&rsquo;ve gotten better with every sketch. So, I&rsquo;m not exactly a pro, yet, but it never hurts to try every time.</p>
<h3 id="what-genres-do-you-work-in">What genre(s) do you work in?</h3>
<p>I draw family-friendly animal-like pictures, with lore behind every picture. I like to tell stories about my characters, and that&rsquo;s what makes &ldquo;Duncan: The Culture&rdquo; so interesting. The story is so rich.</p>
<h3 id="whose-work-inspires-you-most----who-are-your-role-models-as-an-artist">Whose work inspires you most &ndash; who are your role models as an artist?</h3>
<p>As a kid, I was inspired by two very popular artists named <a href="https://lincolnpeirce.com/">Lincoln Peirce</a> and <a href="https://pilkey.com/">Dav Pilkey</a>.</p>
<p>Lincoln Peirce created the Big Nate series, a comic book I loved to read because of the story. It taught me about being friends to one another and learning through the harsh parts of being a student in school.</p>
<p>Dav Pilkey created the Dog Man series. It told the story of a police dog who was given a gift of human characteristics after losing his partner in an accident. It taught me how to be brave and to support people even if I didn&rsquo;t know them.</p>
<p>I wanted to merge those two stories into one, so that&rsquo;s what I did. It may not be the same, but it can teach us more than just being brave or a friend to strangers.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2022/780D3BC8AE4244CA9B11CBBBEBDD41C6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="how-and-when-did-you-get-to-try-digital-painting-for-the-first-time">How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3>
<p>I started my life as an artist on paper. Though it was hard doing that since I would get sweaty palms, scratch marks, and some unknown mechanical pencil lead stuck in the skin of my fingers.</p>
<p>So, when I got my computer a few years ago, the first thing I did was draw using Microsoft Paint. I didn&rsquo;t know about Krita at this time since I was very young and not good at complicated programming.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-you-choose-digital-over-traditional-painting">What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to face the consequences of drawing. I don&rsquo;t have to buy a lot of paper packs and pencils, I don&rsquo;t have to leave special drawings lying around for them to be stepped on and crumpled up by accident, and I don&rsquo;t have to move everything around in a full space to store my drawings.</p>
<p>But with digital painting, you can save the drawing for later and store it with just a click. It was that easy!</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-find-out-about-krita">How did you find out about Krita?</h3>
<p>When I got bored with Microsoft Paint and other third-party programs that ran through Adobe Flash (RIP) or HTML 5, I wanted to do something different. So, I went to my search provider and typed up the best drawing programs that you can find.</p>
<p>The list showed mostly pay-to-use programs such as Photoshop and Procreate. But then I found this one free program on the list called Krita. It was reviewed as easy to use, easy to navigate, and had a wonderful community. So, I chose Krita after reading the review, and I never said the choice was a mistake. It was a gift.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-your-first-impression">What was your first impression?</h3>
<p>At first, it wasn&rsquo;t easy. But since it let me customize everything to my will, I got used to it very quickly.</p>
<p><img src="images/posts/2022/7EE68823D8B4416A8EFE1732B2D61EFC.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-love-about-krita">What do you love about Krita?</h3>
<p>It has vibrant colors to choose from and has a wonderful compatibility with third-party brushes and tools. The program even recognized my new Wacom tablet that I plugged in!</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-think-needs-improvement-in-krita-is-there-anything-that-really-annoys-you">What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3>
<p>At the moment, the program runs perfectly. But there are a few crashes and bugs here and there. That&rsquo;s what bothers me. But with every release, the developers fix it in a jam. So delightful!</p>
<h3 id="what-sets-krita-apart-from-the-other-tools-that-you-use">What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I guess I would just say it&rsquo;s better than Microsoft Paint.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-had-to-pick-one-favourite-of-all-your-work-done-in-krita-so-far-what-would-it-be-and-why">If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3>
<p>I think my best bet would be &ldquo;Duncan Loves Laina&rdquo;. <img src="images/posts/2022/9058DEE56B83413BB264A5883B7C5671.jpg" alt="Duncan loves Laina!"> It shows how much Duncan loves his best friend Laina, even if she&rsquo;s an adult and much taller than him.</p>
<h3 id="what-techniques-and-brushes-did-you-use-in-it">What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3>
<p>I sketched the picture first, then outlined it with ink brushes. Then I drew a layer underneath the outline and colored it in. Once that was done, I enabled &ldquo;Preserve Opacity&rdquo; and colored the outline to fit the layer beneath and shaded the layer beneath with a soft brush.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-people-see-more-of-your-work">Where can people see more of your work?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked. You can check <a href="https://krita-artists.org/u/simonbrother/activity/portfolio">my portfolio at Krita Artists</a>, or go to my website at <a href="https://snowfallsproductions.wixsite.com/duncantheculture">https:// snowfallsproductions.wixsite.com/duncantheculture</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anything-else-youd-like-to-share">Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</h3>
<p>I would just want to thank everyone in the Krita community for making my dream a reality. You are all so gracious!</p>
