      <description>Not directly development related, but the scammers who registered krita.io, krita.app and getkrita.com for ransomware attacks have lost those domains. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that also means the scammers decide they have had enough and stop spamming people.</description>

      <description>For years, most development discussion for Krita has happened on the #krita channel on the Freenode IRC network. IRC is a venerable chat system (that&amp;rsquo;s to say, it&amp;rsquo;s old and quirky) but it works very well for us because it&amp;rsquo;s free and open source software and because it treats chat as chat: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep logs for you if you&amp;rsquo;re not in the channel, there are many clients and interaction is simple and limited to just text.</description>
